The THELI pipeline was originally developed by:

- Thomas Erben (terben@astro.uni-bonn.de)
- Mischa Schirmer (mschirme@gemini.edu)

Significant parts or complete modules were also contributed by:
- Joerg Dietrich (dietrich@usm.lmu.de) (photometric pipeline)
- Patrick Hudelot (hudelot@iap.fr)     (satellite track detection -
                                        external module)

Many users contributed to THELI with feedback, bug reports and
bug fixes - too many to list them here.

In addition, our work is heavily based on publicly available codes
from different sources. In the following we give a list of authors and
supplementary information on original code packages.

Please note that we modified and repackaged most of the original
sources. All our changes are documented in the corresponding sources
and in files called 'CHANGES_THELI'.

Problems/Bug reports for the codes provided in this package should be
adressed directly to me (Thomas Erben; terben@astro.uni-bonn.de). Due
to our (partly substantial) modifications to program functionalities
and the addition of derived work we would like to avoid that the
original authors have to deal with problems they are not responsible
for.

The codes from a particular source are mostly grouped in own
THELI subdiretories.

comment:   the subdirectory eclipsetools/tools contains mostly derived work
           which is not part of the original eclipse and qfits libraries.

ldactools:
==========

download location:             ftp://ftp.strw.leidenunliv.nl/pub/ldac/software
original source package:       ldac.trz (from 04.01.2000)

scripts/astrometrix:
====================
original author:               Mario Radovich (radovich@na.astro.it)
download location:             http://www.na.astro.it/~radovich/wifix.htm
original source package:       WIFIX_Distrib_1.2.tar.gz

comment:   The directory only contains several Perl files that are used
           within THELI instead of the original ones provided in the WIFIX
           package. WIFIX has to be installed independently of the THELI
           archive.

smalltools (dfits.c; replacekey.c; fitsort.c; hierarch28.c):
===========
original author:               ESO 
download location:             http://archive.eso.org/saft/

smalltools (readlink.c):
==========
original author:               Kenneth Stailey
download location:             http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.2/common/readlink.c

download location:             N/A
original source package:       N/A

comment:   The directory is an inhomogeneous collection of own developments
           and derived work from various sources. Most parts originate from an
           early, unpublished version of Nick Kaisers 'imcat' package.
