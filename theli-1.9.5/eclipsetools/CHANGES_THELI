This file describes our use of the 'eclipse/qfits' library routines 
integrated in the THELI pipeline. They originate from the source packages
'eclipse-main-4.6.3.tar.gz' and 'eclipse-main-4.6.3.tar.gz' and were
originally developed by the Eclipse Team at ESO (eclipse-team@eso.org).

In contrast to other foreign packages the eclipse/qfits softwares do
not provide us with ready to use programs but they form, with their
advanced FITS handling and image manipulation functions, the
development library for our preprocessing tools (at the time being
those are mefsplit, mefcreate and preprocess). The stand-alone
programs 'dfits', 'fitsort', 'replacekey', 'hierearch28' and 'iofits'
are used to query/update our FITS headers.

The original codes are rearranged to fit in the THELI installation 
scheme
