This file describes important functional changes in the 'ldactools'
routines integrated in the THELI pipeline. They originate from the
source package ldac.trz and were originally developed by Erik Deul
(deul@strw.leidenuniv.nl).

We only list modifications that are directly visible to users, who are
familiar with the original codes. Most of our changes in this module,
which concern the internal program structures, are not reported here
but documented in the source files.

- the included codes only represent a subset of the original
  source archive. For the current THELI release we started with 
  the source files:

  asctoldac.c, asctoldac_defs.h, assoc_defs.h, assoc_globals.h,
  assoc_types.h, assoc_vers.h, associate.c, bin_search.c,

  posixstat.h, queue.c, queue_globals.h, queue_types.h, refs_io.c,

  utils.c, utils_defs.h, utils_globals.h, utils_macros.h,
  utils_types.h,

  and repackaged them slightly. Overall we chose the original
  ldactools installation scheme for the THELI pipeline and adapted
  other packages accordingly.

- all programs take into account that long variables on 64-bit
  machines have 8 bytes.

- if the result of a program is a new LDAC catalogue it contains history
  information on the program call in the form of HISTRORY FITS keywords.

- the program 'associate' stops if objects with 0 or negative semi
  major/minor axis are found in the input catalogues.

- the functions sin(), cos() and int() can now be used within the 'ldaccalc'
  program.

- the LDAC tools now supprt Large Files, i.e. files larger than 2GB
  on 32-bit systems.
