Installing WeightWatcher is really easy:
- Go to the source/ subdirectory
- Type ``make'' and see if your machine type is listed.
- If this is the case, you can start the compilation with
  ``make SEXMACHINE=<machine_type>''
- The compilation produces the WeightWatcher executable called ``ww''.
  You may now copy it anywhere in your path and run it with a
  configuration file like the one in the config/ subdirectory.
