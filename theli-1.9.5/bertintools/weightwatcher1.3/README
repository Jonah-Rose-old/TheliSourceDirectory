This is V1.2 of WeightWatcher.
The release of this software accompanies the March pre-release of
ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) data.

WeightWatcher is a program that combines weight-maps, flag-maps and
polygon data in order to produce control maps which can directly be
used in astronomical image-processing packages like Drizzle or
SExtractor2.
