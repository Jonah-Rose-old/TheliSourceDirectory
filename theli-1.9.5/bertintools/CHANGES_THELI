This file describes important functional changes in the programs
Sextractor (v2.5.0), swarp (v2.19.1) and weightwatcher (v1.3) originally
developed by E. Bertin (bertin@iap.fr).

Besides the use of the programs itself we integrate E. Bertins
command-line and configuration-file handling into our eclipse and qfits
based preprocessing softwares.

In the following we only list program modifications that are directly
visible to users, who are familiar with the original codes. Changes in
the internal program structures are not reported here but documented
in the source files.

We use 'swarp', 'sex' and 'ww' for modified codes of the original
program versions listed above.

swarp v2.19.1:
==============

- The 'swarp' executable within THELI has the name 'swarp_theli'

- The original package is rearranged to non-GNU installation to be
  consistent with the rest of the THELI installation scheme.

- Image headers from FITS files created by swarp contain version
  number information of the THELI pipeline

- Image headers from FITS files created by swarp contain DUMMY keyword
  at the end. Those can later be replaced by user information.

- I rewrote the header keyword handling so that we obtain consistent,
  and 'nice looking' headers for our special THELI processing
  (A three stage process: first create a header for the final, co-added 
  image, then resample images, and finally coadd them). Probably this breaks
  the standard 'swarp' behaviour in more standard applications!

sextractor v2.5.0:
==================

- The 'sex' executable within THELI has the name 'sex_theli'

- checkimages and FITS_LDAC catalogs created with 'sex' now carry
  THELI pipeline version information in HISTORY FITS keywords

weightwatcher v1.3:
===================

- The 'ww' executable within THELI has the name 'ww_theli'

- FITS images produced by ww now carry history information about
  the program run in the form of HISTORY FITS keywords.

- ww has a new command line option 'POLY_INTERSEC'. If 'Y', overlapping
  polygon areas are masked. If 'N', areas from two polygons that
  overlap are NOT masked (default behaviour of the original ww).
  To implement this feature code was transfered from the official
  v1.7 of weightwatcher.
