This file describes important functional changes in the ASTROMETRIX
and PHOTOMETRIX programs. They are part of the WIFIX package which was
developed by M. Radovich (radovich@na.astro.it).
We only list modifications that are directly visible to users, who are
familiar with the original codes. Changes in the internal program
structures are not reported here but documented in the source files.

In the THELI package we include only several Perl source files
but NOT the complete WIFIX package. Version 1.2 of this software has 
to be installed separately from the THELI package. The modified perl 
scripts in the THELI are then called instead of the original WIFIX sources.

In the following we use 'astrom_theli' and 'photom_theli' for modified 
codes of the original programs 'astrom' and 'photom' in WIFIX 1.2.

astrom_theli:
=============

- The output headers from 'astrom_theli' contain THELI version number and 
  program execution information

- If chips contain the header keyword 'BADCCD' they are not treated
  by 'astrom_theli'. This is the general way in THELI to tell processing
  tasks that an image should not be processed.

- We included the possibility to use USNOB1 and SDSS3 as reference catalogues.

photom_theli:
=============

- The output headers from 'photom_theli' contain THELI version number and 
  program execution information

- The program has two new configuration parameters:
  
  * MAG: This parameter gives the SExtractor magnitude quantity
         that has to be used for relative photometry. The default
         is now MAG_AUTO!!! It is MAG_APER in the original 'photom'
         program.

  * K_FLXSCALE: This parameter gives the FITS header keywords to be 
                written for relative magnitude zeropoints. The default
                is now 'FLXSCALE'. It is 'FLSCALE' in the original
                'photom' program.

- If chips contain the header keyword 'BADCCD' they are not treated
  by 'photom_theli'. This is the general way in THELI to tell processing
  tasks that an image should not be processed.
