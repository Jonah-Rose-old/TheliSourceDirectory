# This script illustrates the basic usage of the THELI pipeline.  The
# commands below process a WFI test data set from raw image to a final
# co-added image.
# At the end of this script we list the individual images which are
# part of this test data set. We give also a very short introduction
# into THELI there.

# This script also serves as an example for possible 'superscripts'
# collecting various pipeline tasks.

# Note that the script (as most of the individual THELI subtasks) 
# does NOT react intelligently on errors during image reduction!!!!

# Here, RUN processing is performed:
# ==================================
# 
# R1: Split the MEF data into individual chips
# ============================================
#
# split data and update headers. This steps takes data
# from ${MD}/BIAS/ORIGINALS (accordingly for other species),
# splits the MEF files into single chips, updates the
# headers to the THELI format and puts resulting files
# to  ${MD}/BIAS etc.

# Here you could do a first data check and verify that the modes of
# raw images are within predefined values. A typical script call to
# only accept for further processing only skyflats with a mode
# between 5000 and 40000 would look like:
# ./check_files.sh ${MD}/ SKYFLAT_${FILTER} 5000 40000
#
# we omit this step as the data were chosen to be good !!

#
# R2: process BIAS frames
# =======================

# Appendix:
#
# 1. (Very) brief introduction to THELI
# =====================================
#
# For details on reduction algorithms and an overview on THELI
# internals see Erben et al. (AN....)
#  
# THELI data-processing, which aims at the production of co-added images from
# dithered observations of different targets happens in two major steps: (1)
# The RUN processing which treats all images of a given observing run for
# removing the instrumental signature; i.e. a RUN represnts a period for which
# the same calibration (BIAS, FLAT, FRINGE correction etc.)  can be applied to
# science images. Obviously observations in different passbands represent
# different RUNS. (2) The SET processing. After RUN processing images are
# rearranged into set which represnt the different targets (possibly in
# different filters) which should result as co-added stacks from THELI
# processing. On SETS the operations astrometric calibration, 'final'
# photometric calibration and co-addition are performed.  Note that a target
# can have been observed in different RUNS!

# THELI expects the data within fixed directory structures for RUNS and SETS. 
# The directory structures head is often called 'MAIN DIRECTORY' (MD) for RUN
# processing and 'SET DIRECTORY' (SD) for work on SETs. Often the same head is 
# used for both structures (as is the case for this script). Unter the head 
# directories for each species of files (BIAS, DARK FLATs, SCIENCE exposures,
# STANDARD stars are created and the original images put therin (see below)
# 
# During processing THELI usually creates new images, subdirectories and
# files therin. Unfortunately documentation of what is created is very poor
# at this stage!
# 
# I advise you to put the data in the directory structure below and to run
# the above scripts step by step to see what is happening. I tried to document
# above what each script produces so that you can check step by step whether
# necessary files have been produced (very preliminary and uncomplete).

# 2. The WFI test data set
# ========================
#
# The test data set being processed by this script consists of R-band images
# from the ESO Imaging Survey Deep Field Deep3a (see
# http://www.eso.org/eis). They should be sorted in a starting directory
# structure as indicated below.
# 
# NOTE: If you get original images with the ending '.fz' they are compressed
# with the so-called Rice algorithm, an optimised compression technique for
# FITS images. To uncompress you can use a tool called 'imcopy' which is based
# on the cfitsio library 
# (see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/cexamples.html)
# 
# The WFI test data set contains in total 61 files:
