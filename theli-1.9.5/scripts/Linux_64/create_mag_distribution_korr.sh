# 23.01.2006:
# The script was adapted to changes in mag_distribution_korr2.sm.
# The instrument to be used (WFI or CFH12K for now) 
# has to be given as script argument now
#
# 30.08.2006:
# The script was adapted to changes in mag_distribution_korr.sm
# (which was formerly mag_distribution_korr2.sm). We included 
# MEGAPRIME@CFHT as new instrument and the describing string
# for comparing number counts is a command line argument now.
#
# 07.02.2013:
# - I introduced the new THELI logging scheme into the script.
# - For KIDS fields, a string that 'sm' was given could become
#   too long - fixed.
#
# 12.02.2013:
# If the initial object catalogue is not present we quit with
# an error message.
#
# 14.01.2014:
# change in the device name of the sm output plot to avoid too long
# strings for 'sm'.

#$1: main dir.
#$2: science dir.
#$3: name of coadded image (without FITS extension)
#$4 colourindex to compare with McCracken et al. 2004 (r,b,v,i bands)
#$5 CLASS_STAR  -
#$6 FLUX_RADIUS -- values to separate between stars & gal.+ fit interval ($4)  
#$7 MAG_AUTO    -
#$8: string for marking comparison number counts

# The script calls the sm-script "mag_distribution_korr2.sm". The
# sm-program expects a asc-file:Xpos Ypos MAG_AUTO ISO0 FLUX_RADIUS CLASS_STAR
 
# It calculates the number of galaxies and stars per 0.5 mag and sq. degree.
# It takes into account that each object occupies an area, so that darker
# objects can not be detected in this area. For this corr. the isophotal area
# ISO0 (isophote above analysis threshold) and the pixel size of pz is taken .   

# The total area is calculated from the position of detected objects.

# To separate stars & gal., CLASS_STAR is taken. Objects with CLASS_STAR > cs
# are defined as stars, if additionally the FLUX_RADIUS < fr (close to half 
# light radius of stars) and MAG_AUTO < ma (close to saturation level).

# The fit of the logarithmic number counts is an error weighted liner regres.
# of the data points between mag ma and the 4th last point (detection limit).    

# By default the separate parameters are: cs=0.04, fr=2.5, ma=17.5 and
# the default filter colour is R

# If you want to change at least one parameter, you have to type all four
# values.
