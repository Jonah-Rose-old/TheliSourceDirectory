#!/usr/bin/bash -u

# the script creates weights and flags for for science and photometric
# standard star frames.  It assumes the global weight images in the
# WEIGHT directory and the reg files in the sciencedir/reg directory.
#
# The current script version is a merging of the 'old'
# 'create_weights_para.sh' and 'create_weights_flags_para.sh' scripts.
#
# 30.05.04:
# temporary files go to a TEMPDIR directory 
#
# 24.08.04:
# the SExtractor call to produce the cosmic ray mask now produces a
# DUMMY catalog in TEMPDIR (avoiding a lot of stdout messages during
# the processing)
#
# 25.04.2006:
# temporarily created FITS files (cosmic ray masks) are removed at the
# end of the script.
#
# 17.07.2006:
# the temporary file cosmic.cat is renamed to a unique name including
# the process number. It is also removed at the end of image
# processing.
#
# 22.09.2006:
# - I introduced the possibility to use specific cosmic ray mask if
#   necessary. The location of such masks has to be given as
#   (optional) command line argument. If a mask is not provided the
#   standard 'cosmic.ret.sex' mask is used.
# - I made the listing of files more robust if many files are involved
#   (by using 'find' instead of 'ls')
#
# 01.08.2007:
# some cleaning of not needed temporary files added
#
# 03.08.2007:
# I merged the two scripts 'create_weights_para.sh' and
# 'create_weights_flags_para.sh'.
#
# 08.08.2011:
# Bug fix concerning the usage of TEMPDIR (The error became apparent
# when the TEMPDIR was not identical to the reduction directory anymore).
#
# 01.01.2013:
# I made the script more robust to non-existing files and directories
#
# 07.04.2014:
# A new command line option to specify whether we have low S/N or high
# S/N data. In the case of low S/N the science data can have valid
# negative values (e.g. very low exposed u-band data in the ATLAS
# survey). In the case of high S/N such pixels are masked and give a
# weight of zero. This is the default for the large majority of our
# data.

# $1: main directory
# $2: science dir.
# $3: image extension (ext) on ..._iext.fits (i is the chip number)
# $4: WEIGHTS, FLAGS OR WEIGHTS_FLAGS
#     determines whether weights, flags or weights AND flags
#     are produced
# $5: LOWSN / HIGHSN (for LOWSN images science images are allowed to
#     have valid, negative values; for HIGHSN images those pixels are
#     masked and given a weight of zero).
# $6: Filter to use for cosmic ray detection (OPTIONAL; if the argument
#     is not given, the default filter 'cosmic.ret.sex' is used)
# ${!#}: chips to be processed
