#!/bin/bash -u

# this script can be considered as the create_drizcl.sh
# part of a coaddition performed with swarp. It mainly creates
# a header file of the final output image from swarp coaddition

# 14.01.2004:
# I introduced the possibility to enter center coordinates
# for the output image. If they are not provided, they are
# taken from one of the input images. Hence the treatment is 
# consistent with that of create_drizcl.sh
#
# 12.02.2004:
# I introduced the possibility to give a directory for
# the WEIGHT images
#
# 19.02.2004:
# Fixed a bug so that given headers (-h option) are now 
# taken into account
#
# 27.04.2004:
# from the swarp output headers, CDELT and PV lines are deleted.
# We assume that input headers carry astrometric information
# in the form of CD matrices.
#
# 29.02.2004:
# If the coaddition directory is already present
# when entering the script, it is either created,
# or old files are deleted. Afterwards, links are
# newly created in any case. The old treatment of
# not recreating links led to errors when determining
# the center position of the pointing.
#
# 01.03.2004:
# the Pixelscale is now manually given in the case
# no header is provided.
# In the same case, from the produced header only 
# possible PV polynomials
# are deleted, not the CDELT keywords anymore. These
# are the only astrometric keywords produced by swarp
# by default (version 1.38)
#
# THE CASE WHERE A HEADER IS PROVIDED IS HIGHLY BUGGY
# (version 1.38 from swarp)
#
# 30.04.2004:
# not used temporary files are deleted at the end now
#
# 28.07.2005:
# - I included the possibility to coadd only the data from
#   a specified chip (command line option '-c').
# - I included the possibiliry to use external headers
#   for all the images.
#
# 23.01.2006:
# if a catalog is given defining conditions on the
# input images we now have to specify the table in which
# the conditions are given.
#
# 25.07.2006:
# - Temporary files get more robust, unique filenames and
#   are deleted at the end of the script.
# - If a CCD has a headerkeyword 'BADCCD' containing '1'
#   that CCD is not considered in the co-addition process.
# - The 'coadd.head' file stored in the reduce directory
#   gets a unique name consisting of science dir. and
#   co-addition identifier. This allows the execution of several
#   co-additions simultaneously.
#
# 23.09.2006:
# The filenames of images to be resampled are passed to swarp 
# no longer on the command line but in a file instead. 
#
# 03.08.2007:
# If external headers are given we check whether images have
# ASTBAD=1 set inside these headers. If yes, the image is not
# included in the co-addition. ASTROMETRIX indicates with this 
# flag (besids with BADCCD=1) that astrometric calibration for 
# this image went wrong.
#
# 15.09.2007:
# It is now necessary to specify the directory of external headers
# (together with the -eh option). This is necessary because with
# the possibility to use scamp for astrometric calibration different
# header directories can exist.
#
# 18.01.2007:
# Tests for bad chips needed to be updated for external scamp headers
#
# 06.02.2008:
# I changed some integer comparisons in 'if' statements to string
# comparisons. An empty string produces no errors in constrast to
# and 'empty' number (empty strings are not automatically converted 
# to numbers).
#
# 12.10.2008:
# I cleaned up the code a bit
#
# 16.09.2010:
# I made the construction of the filename for the coadd.head file
# in the reduce directory more robust. There were problems if
# a pathname ended with a slash. 
#
# 13.10.2010:
# I do not longer assume that images with BADCCD=1 must be present.
# This assumption led to problems with CFHTLenS processing where we
# do not have these images available any more.
#
# 26.11.2010:
# I adapted the call to swarp to the new version 2.19.1
#
# 07.02.2013:
# I introduced the new THELI logging scheme into the script.
#
# 12.02.2013:
# Better error messages in case that no images are to be co-added.
# Previously the exact same error message was given in two places
# of the script.
#
# 24.05.2013:
# Bug fix in the command line parsing. It was not compatible with the
# '-u' bash setting which finishes a script with unbound variables.
#
# 06.02.2014:
# The script exited errorneously if there was an 'empty string' command
# line argument - I wonder why this always worked up to now!
