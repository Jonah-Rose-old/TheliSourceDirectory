#!/bin/bash -u

# the script coadds images with Emmanuels swarp program. It takes the
# resampled images created by resample_coadd_swarp_para.sh.  So far it
# cannot be parallelised!
#
# Note that a coaddition with another header than that created by
# prepare_coadd_swarp.sh and later used by
# resample_coadd_swarp_para.sh leads to false results !!!

# 02.03.2004:
# The ending of the resampled FITS images is now
# "COADIDENT".resamp.fits instead of simply .resamp.fits
#
# 08.06.2006:
# The existence of the file 'coadd.head' is checked before 
# it is being copied.
#
# 17.07.2006:
# The swarp COMBINE_TYPE parameter can now be given as (optional)
# command line argument. If not provided, WEIGHTED is applied.
#
# 25.07.2006:
# The 'coadd.head' file stored in the reduce directory gets a unique
# name consisting of science dir. and co-addition identifier. This
# allows the execution of several co-additions simultaneously.
#
# 28.08.2006:
# The filenames to be co-added are passed to swarp no longer on the
# command line but in a file instead.
#
# 07.09.2006:
# I corrected a bug in the call to swarp. Images were passed on the
# command line AND via a file list.
#
# 17.02.2007:
# A flag map for the co-added image is created. It contains a '1'
# where the wqeight map is zero, i.e. bad pixels are marked.  All
# other pixels get a value of zero. The flag map is an eight bit FITS
# image.
#
# 04.09.2008:
# There are now four more command line arguments:
# - The user needs to provide the image ending for images
#   to be co-added
# - The user needs to provide an ending for the filename
#   of the final co-added image.
# - The user needs to provide the WEIGHT_TYPE of the input
#   weights; this allows us to use no weights at all 
#   (WEIGHT_TYPE NONE)
# - The user decides whether a FLAG map is created or not
#   (it was created by default before)
#
# These changes ensure that the script is more general and can also be
# applied to derived products from resampled images.
#
# 16.09.2010:
# I made the construction of the filename for the coadd.head file
# in the reduce directory more robust. There were problems if
# a pathname ended with a slash. 
#
# 26.11.2010:
# I adapted the call to swarp to the syntax of the new version (2.19.1).
# This includes a different way to provide the image list,
# name of a header keyword for the saturation level and trying to coadd
# data with multiple threads.
#
# 05.05.2011:
# new mandatory command line switch for the path of the coadd.head
# file used by this script. Before the treatment of the coadd.head
# file within this script was completely faulty!
#
# 07.02.2013:
# I introduced the new THELI logging scheme into the script.

#$1: main dir.
#$2: science dir.
#$3: coadd identifier
#$4: image ending of frames to be co-added
#    (including a '.' before the final 'fits')
#$5: ending for the output image; it is defined
#    as coadd.${5}fits
#$6: location of the global coadd.head file (complete absolute path)
#$7: WEIGHT_TYPE of input WEIGHTS
#$8: FLAG/NOFLAG; create a FLAG image or not
#    (Pixels that are zero in the weight map, i.e. bad
#     are masked with a '1' in the flag map.)
#$9: swarp COMBINE_TYPE (OPTIONAL: WEIGHTED as default)
