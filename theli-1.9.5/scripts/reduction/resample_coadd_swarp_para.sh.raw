#!/bin/bash -u

# this script performs resampling of data with swarp preparing the
# final coaddition. It can perform its task in parallel mode.

# 07.11.2003:
# I corrected a bug in the listing of files belonging to
# a certain chip. The old line
# FILES=`ls $1/$2/coadd_$4/*_${CHIP}*$3.fits` did not work
# correctly for more than 10 chips. 
#
# 25.11.2003:
# the location of the coadd.head file is now given as parameter
# (necessary for reductions on marvin where the reduction directories
# of the individual nodes is not the directory where the
# prepare_coadd_swarp script created it)
#
# 02.03.2004:
# The ending of the resampled FITS images is now
# "COADIDENT".resamp.fits instead of simply .resamp.fits
#
# 08.06.2006
# The file 'coadd.head' is no longer removed at the end of the
# processing. If being unlucky it is needed by another process exactly
# at the moment when it is removed by this script. It does not matter
# if it is not removed anyway.
#
# 25.07.2006:
# The 'coadd.head' file stored in the reduce directory gets a unique
# name consisting of science dir. and co-addition identifier. This
# allows the execution of several co-additions simultaneously.
#
# 23.09.2006:
# The filenames of images to be resampled are passed to swarp no
# longer on the command line but in a file instead.
#
# 31.10.2006:
# I corrected a major bug introduced in the changes of 23.09.2006!
# (the script was not functional!)
#
# 21.03.2007:
# I included a test to check whether chips need to be co-added 
# at all. This cleanly treats cases where only individual chips
# of a mosaic should be co-added.
#
# 08.02.2008:
# I merged this script with 'resample_coadd_swarp_CFHTLS_para.sh'.
# A new command line argument determines if the resampled files
# are put where the unresampled files reside (links!) or whether
# they are always created in the 'coadd' directory.
#
# 03.10.2008:
# I add a saturation level keyword to the resampled keywords
# (transfer from the not-resampled ones - if present)
#
# 12.10.2008:
# I make sure that the SATLEVEL keyword is always a float with two
# digits
#
# 16.09.2010:
# I made the construction of the filename for the coadd.head file in
# the reduce directory more robust. There were problems if a pathname
# ended with a slash.
#
# 26.11.2010:
# - I adapted the call to swarp to the syntax of the new version (2.19.1).
#   This includes a different way to provide the image list and the
#   name of a header keyword for the saturation level.
# - Bug fix in the treatment of the SATLEVEL keyword. If it is not present
#   its value was errorneously treated as zero.
#
# 05.05.2011:
# There is now a different 'coadd_$$.head' file for each process of
# this script. Before there was only one coadd.head file. Instances
# of this script checked whether this file existed and if not, copied it.
# It seems that this lead to inconsistencies when several instances
# queried the existence simultaneously. This might be the reason for
# completely faulty coadditions in rare cases.
#
# 07.02.2013:
# I introduced the new THELI logging scheme into the script.
#
# 12.02.2013:
# If there are no images from a chip that should be resampled a
# warning is issued now.

#$1: main dir.
#$2: science dir.
#$3: image extension (ext) on ..._iext.fits (i is the chip number)
#$4: coaddition identifier
#$5: location of the global coadd.head file (complete absolute path)
#$6: FOLLOWLINK/NOFOLLOWLINK; If set to FOLLOWLINK, links from
#    the files to be co-added are followed and the resampled files
#    are put where the linked files are. Otherwise the resampled
#    files stay in the 'coadd' directory.
