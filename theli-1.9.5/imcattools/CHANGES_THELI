This file describes important functional changes in the 'imcat'
routines integrated in the THELI pipeline. They originate from
the source package src_04_19_03.tar.gz and were originally
developed by Nick Kaiser (kaiser@ifa.hawaii.edu).

Besides the use of several original 'imcat' utilities we based
the programs 'imcombflat' (stacking of FITS images) and 'imstats'
(statistics overview for serveral FITS files) on the provided
program libraries.

In the following we only list modifications that are directly visible
to users, who are familiar with the original codes. Changes in the
internal program structures are not reported here but documented in
the source files.

- The provided codes only represent a small subset of the complete
  'imcat' package. We started from the source files:

  album.c, args.(c,h), arrays.(c,h), convertarray.(c,h),
  decimaltodms.c, decimaltohms.c, dmstodecimal.c, error.(c,h),
  fastmap.c, fits.(c,h), getop.(c,h), hmstodecimal.c, ic.c, ic.h,
  imhead.c, iostream.c, iostream.h, makesubimage.c, map.(c,h),
  map_private.h, nan.h, radecio.(c,h), scrunch.(c,h),
  scrunch_stuff.(c,h), stats.c, stats_stuff.(c.h), transformimage.c

  and rearranged them to fit in the THELI distribution structure.

- If the output of a program is a new FITS file, the image contains
  history information on the program call in form of HISTORY FITS
  keywords.

- If HISTORY or COMMENT FITS keywords are written, no '=' at the
  9th line column is written (This was the case in the original
  'imcat' routines).

- The data sections of FITS images are padded with zeros, not with
  tabs (FITS standard).

- Result FITS images are always written in the big-endian byte order
  (The use of the 'imcat' utility 'changesex' is not necessary within
   THELI).
 
- The programs decimaltohms and decimaltodms always print two
  digits for hours, degrees, minutes and seconds (This was not
  the case in the original implementation if the leading digit 
  is a '0').

- The program 'album' now allows a binning of input images. This 
  gives us the possibility to create small 'quick look' mosaics from
  large format CCD cameras. The BITPIX for the output image can
  be chosen between 16 (unsigned integer) and -32 (float). The original 
  '-b' command line option was redefined.

- The program 'makesubimage' allows to extract a subimage w.r.t. image
  coordinates given in CRPIX1, CRPIX2 header keywords. Moreover, those
  header keys are updated whenever a subimage is created.

- The image calculator 'ic' now supports the boolean two-argument 
  operators 'and' and 'or'.

- The imcat utilities now have Large File Support integrated. They can
  handle files larger than 2GB on 32-bit systems.
