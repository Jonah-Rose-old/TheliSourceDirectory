This is version 1.9.5 of THELI
==============================

THELI is an image processing system for the reduction of astronomical
CCD data. Its software modules cover all necessary tasks from raw
images of single- and multi-chip CCD cameras up to astrometrically and
photometrically calibrated co-added images. The main focus is on
observations in optical wavelengths.

THELI IMPLEMENTATIONS
=====================

THELI exists in two flavours. There is a 'command line' based
version in which the user interacts with the system via 'shell
script' commands on the UNIX prompt. 

Mischa Schirmer extended THELI with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
which allows a complete menu-driven work with THELI.  Moreover, he
developed additional codes to process Near-Infrared observations.
This GUI and the Near Infrared modules are NOT included in this
package but are distributed and documented separately.
Necessary source codes for Mischas THELI implementation can be found
at 'http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/theli'

Beginners in the fields of data processing and imaging pipelines are
strongly advised to start with Mischas GUI version.  Users that wish
to process only a small data set, or who intend to use THELI only
occasionally, are also encouraged to use that version. The 'command
line' interface better suits the needs for massive data production of
complete surveys. It is also the method of choice if remote processing
is necessary.  It requires deeper knowledge of THELI internals, and
has higher demands on the users computing knowledge, e.g. bash shell
scripting.

THELI INSTALLATION
==================

Within the THELI source tree go to the subdirectory 'pipesetup'.  Call
the script 'install.sh' which prints installation instructions.  Note
that THELI requires several external programs, and probably additional
installations of third-party software. The installation process tries
to guide you through the complete process. In case of problems with
third-party software, please consult first your local sysadministrator
before writing e-mail to us.

THELI DOCUMENTAION
==================

A scientific justification for the algorithms used in THELI and a
quantification of accuracies obtained when processing optical data
from the multi-chip camera WFI@MPG/ESO2.2m is given in the articles
Erben et al. 2005 (AN 326, 432) for the command-line version of THELI
and in Schirmer 2013 (ApJS 209, 16) for the GUI complement. The
subdirectory 'doc' within the THELI source tree contains scripts and
tutorials for example processings of data sets from WFI@ESO2.2m and
MEGAPRIME@CFHT.

THELI AUTHORSHIP, LICENSE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

accompanying 'AUTHORS' and 'LICENSE' files.

If you use THELI for your own research, please acknowledge
