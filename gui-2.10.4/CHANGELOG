Changelog THELI GUI
===================

v2.10.4 (2016-12-01)

-- Updated to fitstools-1.3.7
-- Added xxxx and yyyy quadrant-independent collapse correction
   for LCOGT cameras
-- Made the background_exclusion file working again
-- Removed the dependency on file extension in id_bright_objects.sh (always OFC)
-- create_illumfringe.sh: smoothed background model was constant because of
   prepare_sex_for_region; commented out background string
-- enforcing constant background in masked areas of illumination correction
   and fringe model (would break collapse correction otherwise)
-- fixed a typo in get_refcat_geometry.sh; handling the border crossing from
   RA>0 to RA<0 was broken.
-- Changed the variable STDCAT_u'g'r'i'z' to STDCAT_ugriz_prime to avoid
   problems when parsing the parameter files
-- Included Smith+ 2007 ugriz southern standard star catalog
-- Fixing the PIXSCALE for GMOS-S-HAM_1x1
-- process_background_assistant_para.sh: replaced sort -n with sort -g
-- Included TRIPOL_1x1@SAAO and TRIPOL-2x2@SAAO
-- Added Gaia DR1 reference catalog

-- Included KTMC@CTIO, FL03_LCOGT@CTIO, FL04_LCOGT@CTIO
-- Updated to fitstools-1.3.6
-- Included a switch between MAG_AUTO and MAG_APER for the module that
   determines the absolute photometric zeropoint of a coadded image
-- Removed all STATSALLIM entries in the instrument configuration files;
   not needed by anything anymore


v2.10.2 (2016-03-28)

-- Included ISPI@CTIO, SWOPE@LCO
-- Preventing two warnings from newer scamp versions to trigger the
   error scanner


v2.10.1 (2016-03-04)

-- Updated the NIRI splitting script and detector mask
-- Fixed bugs in sort_data.sh
-- Updated to wcstools v3.9.2
-- Included 4 configurations for GSAOI that select 1 chip, only (for
   astrometry using crosscorrelation)
-- Updated to fitstools-1.3.4
-- Updated to astrometry.net v0.67
-- Updated dcraw to v9.26
-- Deleting old global weight and flag maps before recreating them.
   There could be a conflict if the same files exist already, but were
   created for a different instrument


v2.10.0 (2015-12-28)

-- Storing collapse correction mask catalogs in MASK_IMAGES
-- Included the WASHINGTON photometric standard star catalog
-- Creating the background_exclusion file automatically based on bright
   star catalogs and user defined mag limits
-- Automatic measurement of optimal astro refcat search radius (this
   time it actually works)
-- Updated background_static.c (did not exit immediately if no matching sky
   found) which would break an 'if' condition in process_background_para.sh;
   would still exit with an error though, so no problem.
-- If gapsize left empty, then the default is set to a very large time span
   instead of 1h, to effectively exclude any gap size to be applied
-- Fixing some lines in the tooltips that didn't wrap properly
-- Added an option to switch off automatic weight rescaling during coaddition
   in case of large galaxies / nebula
-- Upated the MOSAIC_II_15@CTIO splitting script
-- myFITS.cc, split_gmosmultiport.cc, split_grond.cc, paste_dualchannel.cc
   Added readDoubleExtKey() to read double precision keywords (MJD-OBS,
   CRVAL, CD matrix) correctly.
-- install.sh uses parallel build if more than 2 CPUs are available
-- Updated cdsclient to v3.79
-- Included the IGSL, SPM4, URAT1 astrometric reference catalogs
-- Better cleanup of temporary files at the end of create_astromcats_para.sh
-- Using upper maglimit for scamp when doing std star astrometric solution
-- Using STABILITY_TYPE and MOSAIC_TYPE when doing std star astrometry with
   scamp (previously fixed to EXPOSURE and LOOSE)
-- Updated process_split_MOSAIC_II-15@CTIO.sh
-- Added a scamp error message if not enough memory is available (e.g. if
   too many CPUs are being used)
-- Rewrote the DECam splitting script, eliminating two dead CCDs
-- Added region file for DECam chip #31
-- Rewrote DECam album files and DECam inst config
-- Calculating image statistics for binned tiffs from central 60% for
   cameras with circular field (so far: DECam, F2)
-- Including FILTER keyword in the master flat
-- Removed double CTYPE2 keyword from GMOS data (inserted twice during splitting)
-- Added pre-processed ACS@HST images
-- Checking for the presence of .maxlevel when calibrating data; added
   corresponding error message to theliform.ui.h
-- Updated the SOFI splitting script
-- Added GMOS-S_HAM_1x1, and the reg files for the 2x2 configuration
-- Updated writecommhis() in bash_functions.include; it tried to write a temporary file
   to the script directory, for which the user not necessarily has write permission.
-- Deleted an obsolete line in create_abs_photo_info that could trigger the error scanner
-- Updated the FourStar splitting script; bug in MJD-OBS keyword, = sign was not in the 9th column
-- Merged PERSSON and PERSSON_RED JHKKs standard star catalogs
-- Absphot ZPmin ZPmax have no defaults anymore and can be left empty
-- Replaced all 'find' commands by ${P_FIND} (in a few scripts, only)
-- Added the WCS uncertainty (indirect absphot) to the stdstar catalog instead of to the
   observations (was mistakenly the scaling factor, which ended up in the same order of magnitude
   but did not always work). Further advantage: has to be done only once and not for each exposure.
-- Changed g.mag to f.mag for the UCAC4 catalog
-- Included PAUCam@WHT and SAMI@SOAR
-- replaced ${homedir} by ~ in anet.backend.cfg (otherwise problems with write
   permissions if installed by root)
-- Fixed a bug in create_abs_photo_info.sh (nightcalib would replace the "m"
   in the stdcolor with a dash, overwriting the variable instead of
   using a new one. In nightcal mode, an earlier ldactoasc call would
   then fail)
-- Copying input data for the photometric fit to STD/calib/night_xxx.dat
-- parameters.ui.h: Fixed the V_ABSPHOT_STDCOLOR variable. Could have had a
   "-" in it instead of a minus
-- Added COLOR1-4 keywords to megaprime_elixir preprocessed data,
   forcing them to zero
-- Fixing a  bug in sky2xy_helper which would fail for cameras with more than
   33 chips (incorrectly resetting an integer check)
-- Updated to astrometry.net to v0.65
-- Included SITe@TLS


v2.9.9 (2015-04-20)

-- Added FLI-PL16801@WISE and PICCD@WISE
-- Implemented the CLIPPED stacking with SWarp 2.38.1. This is not yet
   working though as it requires external PSF modelling and another task,
   and I have temporarily deactivated it.
-- Updated fitstools to 1.3.1
-- Fitstools: expand_sexmask: do not expand if B_IMAGE < 1.0 (hotpix), and
	reduced default convolution from 3x3 to 1x1 box filter
-- Added SPARTAN@SOAR reg files
-- Updated the SPARTAN splitting script to include the cass rotator angle for
   distortion modelling with scamp
-- Tooltips of the multipage parameter configuration dialog were broken;
   accidentally had a tooltip for the toplevel dialog which shadowed all
   other tooltips
-- background modeling config: renamed "FILTER" to "CONVOLVE", to avoid
   confusion (could be wrongly interpreted as filtering out hot pixels)
-- Updated to astrometry.net v0.53
-- Fixed a bug in the calculation of GABODSID in the GMOS-S-HAM splitting script
-- Do not launch a second instance of theli if a first one is already running.
   Not offering to 'parakill' the first instance anymore, as that did not
   work in all cases.


v2.9.8 (2015-02-26)

-- Fixed a bug in bash.functions (STATXMIN instead of STATSXMIN).
   Flamingos2, GMOS-N and GMOS-S configurations had STATXMIN instead of
   STATSXMIN (and the corresponding YMIN, XMAX, YMAX) parameters written 
   in their configuration file. Afaik, the effect has been negligible.
-- progs.ini still linked to some old python scripts under 
   THELI/theli/scripts/<OS> that used pyfits instead of astropy.io.fits.
   Not a bug, but inconsistent.
-- Updated install.sh
-- create_stdphotom_prepare.sh: Updated to use XWIN_IMAGE, YWIN_IMAGE 
   and THETAWIN_2000
-- create_stdphotom_prepare.sh: Had to replace LANDOLT and STETSON with
   LANDOLT_UBVRI and STETSON_UBVRI
-- Added another tab to the astrometry configure menu, where the user
   selects suitable absolute photometric solutions (if applicable).
-- Updated create_abs_photo_info.sh, create_stats_table.sh, and
   create_absphotom_coadd.sh to work with the new scheme
-- Replaced photo_abs.py by zpabs.cc and zpabs.py; I did not like the
   stability of the original python fit and replaced it with GSL; also, the
   plotting has been improved, and the GUI has more options to fine-tune
   the fit. Now propagating color terms as well. 4 fits are calculated
   instead of 3.
-- Code cleanup in parameters.ui.h, theliform.ui.h and functions.h
-- Fixing the default color term for absphotometry from 0.1 to 0.0.
-- Replaced DATE-OBS by MJD-OBS in prepare_coadd_swarp.sh


v2.9.7 (2014-12-16)

-- Fixed a bug in the normalized flats (would be blank, 
   introduced in 2.9.6)
-- "Spread sequence" task was not connected, and had the wrong
   syntax (missing 'OFC'); looks like noone has reduced LIRIS
   data forever :-)


v2.9.6 (2014-11-04)

-- Bug fix for GMOS: image statistics for flat normalization 
   would not be calculated correctly (only relevant for detectors where
   about half or more of the area is masked);
   Affected create_flat_ratios.sh and process_science_para.sh
   The get_statminsection bash function did not have the CHIP argument
   passed into it in these cases
-- Replaced IMAGEID keyword (phased out a long time ago with astrometrix)
   in makemovie_step1.sh and constructing it on the fly
-- Removed IMAGEID keyword from create_headerastrom.sh, 
   create_xcorrastrom.sh and create_zeroorderastrom.sh
   (was just passively passed along) and from several 
   gui/reduction/make_ssc_xxx config files (commented out)
-- Fixed a bug in process_split_INGRID@WHT, which noone has used in about 
   a decade. I still had a 'ic' there instead of ${P_IC}. Found the same 
   mistake in makemovie_step1.sh (animation of resampled images) and
   process_split_SuprimeCam_200808_SDFRED@SUBARU.sh
-- Added . bash.include to several scripts
-- Fixed a bug in background_static (assigned blocks correctly, but
   would print wrong image lists to the command line)
-- imstats would not calculate statistics from statminsection if available
-- Switched MAG_AUTO to aperture magnitudes for the indirect photometric 
   calibration module. Added the aperture diameter as a user-defined parameter
-- Included nonlinearity correction for GSAOI
-- Adjusted MJD-OBS for GMOS-S_HAM


v2.9.5 (2014-09-16)

-- Updated dcraw to v9.22
-- Fixed a bug in backgroundmodel_dynamic (would erroneously print an 
   error message)
-- added "has flux scale = 0: I will take 1 instead" to the error scan list
-- collapse correction would not read mask expansion parameter
-- deleting dummy weights (region masking) upon start of background
   and collapse scripts
-- fitscopyhead was exiting early (return statement in wrong place)
-- excluding spurious detections in expand_sexmask and subsky 
   (sextractor detections may appear just outside the image boundary for 
   very low detection thresholds)
-- subsky optimized the mask expansion loop (drastic speed improvement if
   lots of objects are to be masked); not expansing object masks if no
   expansion parameter is provided
-- Updated GROND configuration
-- Added 'split_grond' to the fitstools
-- Updated to fitstools v1.2
-- Using windowed sextractor parameters instead of unwindowed ones


v2.9.4 (2014-07-25)

-- Added support for GMOS-N data taken with 2 readouts
-- Added support for GMOS-S Hamamatsu detector array
-- Updated to fitstools v1.1
-- Added ApogeeAlta@PROMPT4
-- Fixed minor bugs in the splitting scripts of FORS2_2CCD and 
   ApogeeAlta@PROMPT5
-- Fixed a bug in the background modelling: if the gap size was
   left empty, it was not reset to its default value of 1h, and an
   empty argument was passed to the script, resulting in an error
-- Updated astrometry.net to v0.50
-- Updated gifsicle to v1.84
-- Replacing blank spaces in OBJECT keyword with underscores


v2.9.3 (2014-06-13)

-- Added WFC_IPHAS@INT
-- Adapted F2 splitting script to catch pathologic F2 headers (very rare)


v2.9.2 (2014-05-22)

-- Regression: aplastrom_scamp.py was using pyfits instead of 
   astropython.io.fits. No problem if pyfits is installed.
   Introduced in 2.9.1 when switching from theli-1.7.6 to theli-1.9.5.


v2.9.1 (2014-05-17)

-- Enforces theli-1.9.5!
-- Minimum changes possible to update to theli-1.9.5.tgz; copied
   photo_abs.py, aplastrom_scamp.py, bash_functions.include;
   the latter was slightly modified to suppress theli jumping upon the
   "error" strings
-- Removed Sextractor 2.5 from the gui package as it is now contained
   in the pipeline core
-- Added automatic mask expansion based on sextractor catalogs to
   the background modeling, collapse correction and sky subtraction
   modules, with greatly improved results
-- Fixed regression in skysubscript, introduced in 2.9.0
-- Updated fitstools package (compatibility with newest gcc versions,
   i.e. v4.8.3)
-- Suppressing an unrelevant error message created when trying to 
   measure the seeing in an image with an insufficient number of objects
-- Added missing FWHM_[IMAGE|WORLD] keyword to FIELDS tables in
   case no stars were identified (keywords required for compatibility 
   reasons)
-- Fixed a bug in the new fitstools concerning stripping whitespace
   in strings
-- Fixed a bug in the new fitstools concerning mask creation based on
   ds9 files
-- Updated the GSAOI chip ds9 masks (covering the chip borders and some 
   bad clusters)
-- Limiting the number lines simultaneously read by swarpfilter.
   Could get >>>1000 on machines with lots of memory, leading to an allocation
   problem with the CCfits library
-- FITS header in tiff2fits.cc was not properly created and had keywords 
   missing.
-- Color calibration would not calculate "average white" correction factors 
   if no photometric reference sources were found
-- Enforcing a max string length of 37 characters for the coadd ID string,
   otherwise 'ldacfilter' will segfault.
-- fitstools did not compile with gcc v4.7 or later, as (1) <unistd.h> is no
   longer included implicitly, and (2) functions used in template functions
   must be declared before the template functions.


v2.9.0 (2014-05-09)

-- Updated the SuprimeCam2008 album confoguration file to display the
   relative chip positions correctly in the binned mosaic previews
-- Fixed regression in the defect mapping 
-- Updated T-ReCS splitting script (skipping over bad single exposures 
   with lots of NaNs)
-- Check for existing skybackground.use file if manual sky sub defined
   (fails if user manually copied data around)
-- Remove double occurrence of the script calculating the flat ratios if
   a dark flat is present
-- Updated the GSAOI splitting script (reference pixel has changed)
-- Updated the Apogee@PROMPT5 splitting script (correcting for image flip)
-- made create_astromcats_para.sh more stable against exposures with very 
   few sources
-- added support in the splitting script for DSLR cameras without Bayer 
   matrix
-- Abs. photometric ZP module would not display ZP values 
   (didn't filter out a false error message from the logfile); regression
-- Included the new prime focus imager at the WHT, PFC_new@WHT
-- Added a "match WCS" switch to scamp
-- Updated sort_rawdata.sh (checking that files are FITS, and not moving 
   them anywhere otherwise); leaves files where they are if accidentally 
   run on a wrong directory
-- Updated the WIRCAM@CFHT splitting script (did not reflect MJD-OBS 
   correctly)
-- Updated to missfits-2.8.0, stiff-2.4.0, astrometry.net-0.46
-- Replaced pyfits with astropy.io.fits; astrometry.net still needs 
   pyfits (v3.1 or newer), though
-- Changed the color calibration method (calculates all options and lets
   the user switch; also automatically expands search range if no sources 
   are found, up to a factor of 2)
-- Replaced the VISIR splitting program with a python script (preliminary)
-- Replaced the 'fitstools' by a much cleaner C++ version, depending on
   CCfits (new installation dependency) and fftw++ (distributed with Theli)


v2.8.3 (2013-11-01)

-- Fixed a small bug introduced in 2.8.2 (swarpfilter script)


v2.8.2 (2013-10-29)

-- Updated gifsicle to v1.71
-- Included ApogeeAlta@PROMPT5
-- If FLAT/.maxlevel.dat does not exist when calibrating the data
   (e.g. an old or external master flat was loaded), then it is 
   created on the fly


v2.8.1 (2013-09-06)

-- Fixed a memory bug that could lead to a segfault at start-up
   when compiled with gcc versions > 4.8. Introduced in 2.7.0.


v2.8.0 (2013-08-24)

-- Compatible only with theli-v1.7.6
-- Introduced RUNCALIB and NIGHTCALIB modes for indirect absolute 
   photometric calibration
-- Drastic speed improvement during the "calibrate data" step for 
   multi-chip cameras; finally got rid of a really narrow bottleneck
-- Fixed a bug occurring when dividing by an unsmoothed superflat
   (regression)


v2.7.2 (2013-08-06)

-- Using the SATURATION level from create source cat when creating catalogs
   for photometric standards
-- Providing the option to NOT do astrometry for photometric standard star 
   fields; useful if e.g. source density is generally too low for a scamp 
   solution, e.g. with near-IR cameras such as SPARTAN
-- Updated photo_abs.py with that from theli-1.7.6 (temp. release)
-- Updated VIMOS album configuration
-- Limiting the astrometry.net scale to a maximum value of 19 (some fish-eye 
   lenses yielded values higher than that, which are not recognized by a.net).
-- Fixed a bug that occured sometimes when a larger number of external swarp 
   threads were launched with large multi-chip cameras (CCDs got misplaced 
   in the output image).
-- Updated astrometry.net to v0.43
-- Added 'nano' as a minimal editor; should be default if no other editor is 
   present on the system
-- Disabling deblooming task when NIR/MIR cameras are loaded
-- Updated the gain values for Flamingos, GMOS-S, and GSAOI


v2.7.1 (2013-07-21)

-- Updated the GMOS-S/N splitting script (MJD-OBS was not always correctly read,
   and shortening the FILTER keyword)
-- Updated the OMEGACAM splitting script
-- Enforcing the upper limit of 1000 for NFRAMES
-- Fixed a bug in the manual sky configuration and the prepare colour dialog 
   in which the sky box might not have been read correctly under certain 
   circumstances (was comparing strings and not integers).
-- Updated some tool-tips
-- The HIERARCH ESO FILT1 NAME keyword was incorrect for OMEGACAM
-- Modified the constant sky background script (if estimate is taken from one
   chip only, or from an area), so that processes don't repeat steps for 
   mosaic cameras. Faster execution. 
-- Cleanup of skysub command-line syntax (removing fixed arguments that 
   never changed)
-- Removed the seeing convolution code from the source (prepare colour picture 
   dialog). It was too simple and never worked properly. Replaced it with a 
   module that allows broad- and narrow-band image combination preserving 
   stellar colors.
-- Disabling NIR/MIR functions when optical cameras are loaded, and vice versa
-- MID-IR cameras (TRECS) can optionally have the cube split or stacked upon 
   splitting


v2.7.0 (2013-05-17)

-- Measured the .ahead file for MOIRCS@SUBARU, and added the polygon masks
-- Fixed the long-standing problem of missing weights during superflat
   creation/collapse correction when polygon masks were present; 
   creating dummy weights on the fly
-- global flag maps were not in integer format if polygon masks were present.
   Modified 'fitspolygon' accordingly.
-- Supporting dark FLAT operations for near-IR data
-- Renamed OFFTARGET to SKY
-- Added WFI_2x2@MPGESO, Tek2K@CTIO
-- Updated to astrometry.net v0.40
-- Updated EMMI_RILD splitting script
-- Added global .ahead file for EMMI_RILD
-- Scamp script for photometric zeropoints did not work anymore.
   Merged with normal scamp script
-- Photometric zeropoints did not work if Scamp was calculated with
   distort_degrees=1 (aplastrom_scamp.py expect PVi_j terms, so I added
   PV1_0, PV1_1, PV2_0, PV2_1, set to 0 and 1, respectively)
-- Constant sky subtraction did not support polynomials; now does.
-- Updated GMOS-N/S configurations
-- Corrected 'nightid' call in splitting scripts (defaulted to UTC+4 for Chile)
-- Automatically increasing POSANGLE_MAXERR for multi-chip cameras if using
   the default focal plane (and if POSANGLE_MAXERR chosen too small)
-- Updated the OSIRIS_F3/7@SOAR splitting scripts
-- reduction/imred.conf had an upper limit for the values to be combined.
   Could compromise NIR exposures with larger NDITs
-- Added MJD-OBS to the splitting script of to all professional cameras
-- DRASTIC simplifications of all background modelling tasks.
   Superflatting, defringing, mask creation, subtraction etc is now
   all handled by one script. Dynamic sky modelling finally working.
   Restructured calibration and superflatting (now: background)
   sections accordingly.
-- Improved the imalyzer
-- Updated the splitting script for NICS@TNG
-- Introduced magnitude limit for GSC-2.3 refcat, downloading only red	
   magnitudes instead of BVRI; removed GSC-1.2 (made obsolete by these 
   changes)
-- Fixed some memory leaks occuring when closing the GUI. Still segfaults, though.
-- Fixed the port accessed by scamp in the photometry module to 1660 (is 80
   in newer versions of scamp); could lead to no reference sources downloaded.


v2.6.2 (2012-11-19)

-- Fixed the astrometry.net installation (catalogs and indices had to be
   sorted with respect to magnitude in order to work properly), and a few
   other details. Still, it is not as reliable as I expected, some fields 
   just won't solve even though they should.
-- Introduced a time-out of 3s when retrieving the current GUI server version
   (wget would take very long before returning if the server can't be 
   contacted). This would make the GUI stall at the splash screen
-- Fixed the automatic determination of the reference catalog radius.
   For multi-chip cameras with varying chip orientations the radius would
   be significantly under-estimated. Correctly estimating the dither
   radius as well.


v2.6.1 (2012-11-13)

-- Added "did not solve" to the error scanner
-- Forcing globalflag to have 8 bit. In case of polygon masks they were 
   floating point.
-- create_illumfringe_para.sh would not work properly if ds9 detector 
   masks were present
-- Fixed a typo in create_superflat_para.sh introduced in 2.6.0, which 
   affected datasets with ds9 detector masks
-- Replaced SDSS-DR8 with SDSS-DR9 (improved astrometry for DEC > +41 deg)
-- Scamp distortion order would not be read from logfile (broken in 2.6.0
   introducing a.net) when opening configuration dialog
-- Updated dcraw to v9.16
-- Saturation value (create source cat config) would not be restored 
   properly
-- Included MEGACAM_2x2@LCO
-- Added missing / corrected wrong tool tips in the GUI, slight reformatting
   of some dialogs, giving some buttons and fields a clearer name
   (e.g. sky sub: FWHM -> kernel width)
-- Ask whether running sub-dialogs should be destroyed when their processes
   are still running. If yes, processes will be aborted.
-- Renamed the LOG file into Project; mirroring the Project name in the 
   main window title and the header of the coadded image
-- Timeout a.net if an exposure isn't solved after 10s (before: 300s)
-- Checking the Qt version in the installation script


v2.6.0 (2012-10-08)

-- Offering astrometry.net as an alternative astrometric solver.
   Ignoring distortion terms, as SIP polynomials are not yet supported by SWarp.
   Should not be used with mosaic cameras, or if distortion has to be corrected.
   Photometric zeropoints are still calculated with scamp. Absolute photometry
   is still based on scamp, only.
-- updated pmonitor to v0.35
-- Included an optional saturation value for the source cat creation


v2.5.4 (2012-09-30)

-- Improved usage of individual and global detector region ds9 masks
   for weight and flag creation, superflatting, sky subtraction and 
   collapse correction. In some cases statistics would not be calculated 
   correctly, or superflats had excessive masking
-- Included DECam@CTIO
-- Restructured collapse correction configuration
-- Optionally, no source detection for object masking takes place
   for the collapse correction (leave detection thresholds empty)
-- Support for UCAC4
-- Included OSIRIS_F7@SOAR (OSIRIS_F3@SOAR was already present)


v2.5.3 (2012-08-17)

-- Splitting script creation tool would not predict syntax correctly 
   if RA DEC keywords have format HH MM SS or DD MM SS (compared to
   HH:MM:SS).
-- Create superflat would complain if no globalweights are present;
   this happens now only if global region files are present (i.e. I 
   still have to find a better solution).
-- Included FourStar@LCO, MMIRS@LCO, and IMACS_F2/4@LCO (the latter based 
   on the new detectors) and AltaU42_HIGH/LOWRES@ASV
-- Statistics module: filter was not set to "*.fits" if left empty
-- Switching off defect detection as default
-- automatically downloaded standard star astrometric reference catalog	
   has now a different name than the refcat for the science exposures.
-- Hiding the seeing convolution task from "prepare colour picture";
   This does not work properly without reasonable PSF modelling
-- updated cdsclient to v3.71


v2.5.2 (2012-07-12)

-- Fixed the ACAM@WHT splitting script once more.
-- Create color picture and manual sky: if empty sky regions have
   min and max values inverted, swap them internally.
-- Checking online for newer versions when showing an error message;
   reminding the user to update.
-- Deactivated defect detection for cameras with colour chip
-- Included SDSS as an instrument
-- Fixed a bug in create_superflat_script that did not write SKYVALUE
   correctly into the fits header for the 'subtract' method
-- Updated create_stats_table.sh such that bad images that were moved to a
   parking directory after catalog creation are ignored
-- Updates to spectroscopic programs in fitstools
-- Updated SOFI@NTT splitting script (creating CD matrix correctly if 
   PC matrix is present; better reconstruction of FILTER keyword)
-- create_superflat_para.sh: The 'rescale' flag was always set to "Y"
   when subtracting a dynamic superflat on the fly, i.e. the setting
   in the superflatting section was ignored
-- Updated to cdsclient-3.7
-- Fixed create_astromcats_[phot]_para.sh; if "lownum" images were encountered,
   the scripts did not switch back to ${SCRIPTDIR}, resulting in an error.
-- SCRIPTDIR was undefined in create_globalweights_para.sh
   (without consequences)
-- distribute target sets would predict wrong file name extension if
   individual chip zeropoint adjustment was done previously ("P").


v2.5.1 (2012-03-05)

-- Updated getkey.c, such that it optionally replaces blanks by ":" instead of
   an "_"
-- Updated creation splitting script, to better cope with non-standard
   "HH MM SS" coordinate formats
-- Added DATE-OBS keyword to WFC_2x2
-- Added Y4KCam@CTIO


v2.5.0 (2012-02-03)

-- This version is only compatible with theli-1.6.1 (long-standing bug 
   fixes in ldactools; will now also run under latest linux flavours);
   I increased the number of max pointers in xmemory.c from 32771 to 200000
   in theli-1.6.1
-- Added "Operation not supported" to the error scanner
-- Fixed a bug in the get_wcs function (introduced in 2.4.0)
-- Included OMEGACAM@VST
-- Updated WFI@MPGESO splitting script
-- Added "buffer overflow detected" to the error scanner
-- Added "Not enough memory" to the error scanner
-- Updated the FLAMINGOS2 pixelscale from 0.18 to 0.1807 pixel
-- Removed Sextractor sky background modelling from the GUI
-- Parallelised fitsgauss.c
-- Drastic speed improvement for fitsfill.c
-- Merged fitsfill.c and fitsgauss.c into subsky.c; this will 
   form the new general purpose sky background modelling tool;
   further multi-threading in former fitsfill code (now in subsky.c)
-- Making statistics section variable and more commonly used;
   helps cameras with strongly vignetted areas
-- Removed Sextractor SIZE parameter from superflatting. Never used
   in years.
-- Removed WIFIX; haven't been using it in years.
-- Updates in the GUI-internal help dialogs and tool-tips
-- Introducing ds9 region files in several places to support reduction
   of strongly vignetted cameras (e.g. those with circular data fields)
-- Removed a lot of unused variables in the GUI and from fitstools
-- Several (not pipeline-related) additions to fitstools
-- Do not rotate global .ahead file if rotation would be smaller than 
   1.5 degrees
-- Included a global region file for ACAM
-- Added "Cannot decode file" to the error scanner
-- Exiting create_scamp.sh if no source catalogs are present
-- Included MKO, HUNT, PERSSON, 2MASSfaint JAC JHK+LM NIR phot std catalogs
-- Included SDSS Stripe82 ugriz and u'g'r'i'z' photometric std catalog
-- Added a missing ". bash.include" to 'create_astromcats_phot_para.sh'
-- Aborting superflat creation if less than 2 images contribute
   (due to high nhigh parameters)
-- Additional filtering of the source catalog for instruments with a global 
   region file (to reject sources lying just outside the edge of the real 
   data field)
-- Fixed a bug in theliform.ui.h concerning absolute photometry.
   I think it didn't have an effect so far, but it would have become 
   serious with the introduction of the near-IR phot std catalogs
-- Speeding up fitsmedian, adding masking capabilities to fitscollapse.
-- Absphotom fixes in theliform.ui.h
-- Increased MEMORY_PIXSTACK in image-object.sex, detection buffer filled 
   up, leading to only partially filled segmentation maps
-- Included SDSS-DR8 (accessing the SDSS database directly through a SQL query)
-- Suppressing two erroneously shown error messages (if more than one cpu
   was used for a multi-chip camera data set); error scanner stumbling over
   chopped up 'error' strings in these scripts
-- Fixed missing ERRA/B/THETA_WORLD keywords (scamp must have used internal 
   defaults, which so far worked fine, but failed for extremely high-res
   MCAO data)
-- Added real ERRA/B/THETA_WORLD values (instead of generic values) if 
   reference catalogue is created from an image; again, the generic ones 
   failed for high-res MCAO images
-- Removed unneeded parameters from the source catalogs (were needed for
   astrometrix, only)
-- Added GSAOI@GEMINI-SOUTH
-- Generally more support for polygon masks in different places
-- Optionally saving the sky background model
-- Fixed a bug in resample_coadd_swarp_para.sh (DATE-OBS keyword was 
   overwriting IMAGEID); now using COPY_KEYWORDS option in swarp.
   Only affected movie-making
-- Deactivated the rotation of global .ahead files. The transformation is
   invalid if the CD matrix is not purely rotational (these terms do not
   rotate, e.g. differential atmospheric refraction)
-- Added the option to resolve target names with Simbad, NED and VizieR
-- Automatic determination of the optimal refcat search radius,
   taking into account detector geometry and dither pattern (the latter only
   if reflected in the CRVAL1/2 keywords)
-- Significant code simplifications in several places
-- global weights: in case of a constant weight the flag map was set to 1 
   instead of 0.
-- added polygon support for flag maps
-- color_correction_photcat|avgwhite.sh: introduced a 0.85*maxval cutoff to
   explicitly avoid saturated stars
-- color_correction_photcat|avgwhite.sh: adjusted DT and DMIN to larger values
   (5 instead of 2); crashed on extremely crowded fields
-- removed refra, refdec, rad, maglim from command line arguments; passing them
   through a parameter file instead (more code consistency, and cleaner data
   flow)
-- Reset tolerances from 1.0 to 10.0 in stdphotom_prepare_associate.conf,
   to accomodate large proper motions
-- reading RA DEC keywords in hex format with blanks instead of ":" was broken
   in automatically created splitting scripts (got confused with standalone
   'getkey' c-programme, and get_key bash function)
-- introduced DATE-OBS keyword and applied rotation correction to CD matrix
   in LIRIS splitting script
-- taking the mode of the image instead of the mode of the background value
   to estimate SKYVALUE keyword when subtracting superflat; better, and
   no need anymore to explicitly take into account rescaling factors
-- SKYVALUE keyword was not properly propagated when subtracting the superflat
-- Subtract superflat and merge sequence: automatic mechanism was broken
   (erroneously printing a STOP message)
-- Added 'try a different download server' to the list of suggestions if the
   reference catalog comes back empty
-- Changed an error message in create_superflat_para.sh ("Only 1 or less images
   contribute to the superflat")
-- Removed further file order randomisations from scamp scripts
-- Updated create_stats_table.sh script (total rewrite by thomas, 
   much more efficient in case of large surveys or huge catalogs); updated
   update_coadd_header.sh accordingly
-- Updated dcraw to version 9.12 (switched off jpeg, jasper and cms dependency)
-- Forcing scamp to use distort=1 in case of single-chip cameras and standard 
   star fields
-- Fixed a bug in the filter order of stdphotom_prepare_make_ssc_UBVRI.conf
-- Fixed the problem that the coadd_<filter> was not identified if the user did
   not click on 'configure'
-- Improved GMOS-SOUTH splitting script drastically (much better WCS in the 
   header)
-- DSLR RAW splitting scripts don't have the option to rename the image to some
   FITS header keyword


v2.4.1 (2011-10-17)

-- Improved the prediction of the size of the output coadded image
   for rotated images. However, it's not perfect. To this end I would 
   need to rotate the headers of the input files to zero degree 
   position angle, which, in case of mixed input rotation angles, would
   totally corrupt the result. Hence I think we have to live with large
   empty borders around stacked images.


v2.4.0 (2011-10-13)

-- Updated the splitting script for VIMOS
-- Introduced a bash 'get_key' function. The C-routine turned out to have
   an excessively large overhead.
-- Included FLAMINGOS2@GEMINI-SOUTH
-- Tiny layout change in the splitting script dialogue
-- Added 'cleanstring.c'
-- Replaced all calls to P_GETKEY by get_key, piping them through 'cleanstring'
   if necessary. This should speed up in particular the splitting step 
   significantly; modified cni_form.ui.h and color_form.ui.h. accordingly
-- Rewrote fitscollapse.c, including a mode for HAWAII-2 detectors with
   four "crossed" readout quadrants; updated parameters.ui.h accordingly
-- Create new instrument: checking if cut-on x|y values are larger than zero
-- Updated the splitting script for GMOS@GEMINI-NORTH/SOUTH
-- Fixed a bug in create_astrorefcat_fromIMAGE.sh (catalog for overlay
   would not be saved in SCIENCE/cat/[ds9|sky]cat
-- Some cleanup in fitstools, and small additions
-- Moderate speed-up of the collapse correction (absorbing/avoiding some 
   I/O in fitscollapse.c)
-- (probably) fixing the occasional "du: cannot access ds9..." 
   in the konsole (file deleted while disk space is evaluated)
-- Included SPARTAN@SOAR.ahead; calibrated against VISTA data
-- Changed collapse correction default rejection threshold from 2.5 to 1.5
-- Storing dynamic background models in a separate BACKGROUND directory
-- Fixed a tooltip in the scamp configure dialogue (showed FIX_FOCALPLANE
   instead of SAME_CRVAL)
-- Added a header explanation line to the collapse parameter dialogue
-- Fixed the pixel scale for SPARTAN@SOAR (was 0.15 instead of 0.069)
-- Blanking bad pixels (weight=0) in coadd.fits; improves data with 
   strong vignetting significantly.
-- Adding SWARP combine-type CHI2, and SUPERGALACTIC coordinate system.
-- Keeping only CRPIX1/2 and the CD-matrix in newly created scamp 
   global header files (could cause problems for large dither patterns).
-- Removed coordinate-specific data from WFC_2x2@INT.ahead, which caused this
   configuration to fail
-- Speeding up near-IR double-pass skybackground significantly:
   creating masked OFC files directly from 'fitscollapse'.
-- Linking *.scamp.cat files to astrom_photom_scamp instead of copying 
   them. In case of e.g. large VISTA data sets this saves a lot of time 
   and disk space.
-- Parallelised resample_coadd_swarp (each chip gets an optimal number of 
   threads assigned, depending how many chips the camera has, and how many
   threads/CPUs the user wants to use); should be a gain of 2-4 in speed
   depending on image size
-- Determining the number of cores/cpus available, and setting an according
   limit to the CPU spinbox in the initialise section
-- Cleaning up tmp-dir upon startup
-- Renaming SUBCOLL_IMAGES and SUB_IMAGES to MASK_IMAGES
-- Collapse correction does now accept a box to be masked, instead of
   defining good rows or columns only; much more flexible.
-- Added a parameter to 'collapse correction', stating what to do with 
   the mask file (delete; mask input image; mask OFC image for 2-pass sky 
   subtraction)
-- Re-measured VIRCAM@VISTA.ahead
-- Mask overlapping polygon areas as well (create_weights_para.sh)
-- Replaced sextractor 2.2.2 with sextractor 2.5.0 (because it is multithreaded)
-- Parallelised all sextractor calls (doesn't really gain much)
-- Added get_pixscale.c and numcpu.c to 'stuff'
-- Fixed inconsistent use of $PIXSCALE (for cameras with exchangable 
   fore-optics such as SPARTAN or FORS); could result in wrong seeing 
   measurements
-- Fixed a bug in create_absphotom_coadd.sh (would not exit properly if some 
   data is absent)
-- Deleting temporary data created by create_stats_table.sh
   (intermediate files can become HUGE, e.g. for VISTA data)
-- Included non-linearity correction for SPARTAN@SOAR
-- I switched off the file order randomisation in scamp
-- Fixed bugs in get_posangle.c, get_cdmatrix.c and sky2xy_helper.c
-- Code cleanup in various stuff/ tools
-- Keeping only files in fitstools package that actually require qfits library;
   moved the rest to stuff/
-- Collected stuff/*.c under a Makefile
-- Added rotate_cdmatrix.c and fitscdinfo.c to fitstools
-- Pre-defined default scamp global.ahead files now get rotated such that
   they match the position angle of the input exposures. No need anymore to
   set POSANGLE_MAXERR to 180 for pre-defined multi-chip cameras. This should
   help in particular small fields of view and near-IR cameras.
-- Fixed a bug in get_coadd_zp.sh (FITS header card was too long, keyword 
   not written)
-- Added "keyword unknown" to the error scanner
-- Rewrote swarpfilter.c; significant gain in speed (~30% lower execution 
   time for large mosaic data sets); qfits is not threadsafe, hence I cannot
   parallelise swarpfilter.
-- Updated SOI@SOAR.ahead and IMACS_F2@LCO.ahead
-- Fixed a rare problem with getting the reference catalog.
   If the median ref RA/DEC was integer, the CDS scripts don't return results.


v2.3.10 (2011-08-22)

-- The parameter configuration dialog extended too much in
   vertical direction. On systems with low screen resolution
   in y (around 768 pixels) the dialog was truncated, hiding the
   'ok' button.
-- Removed the (already hidden) 'use header' option with scamp.
-- fitsblockedit: added the option to negate the selection, and
   added circular patterns as well.


v2.3.9 (2011-08-19)

-- Added 'cannot execute binary file' to the error scanner
-- Added 'Not enough memory' to the error scanner
-- The const-sky estimate from RA/DEC would not write the correct 
   values into the table when 'get estimates' was clicked. This has never 
   been implemented and only worked for x/y. However, if 'get estimates'
   was not clicked, the correct values would be applied. This is now fixed.
-- Included the DATE-OBS keyword in resampled images
-- SOI@SOAR renames raw files to SOI.${DATEOBS}.fits
-- Changed the default setting for scaling the fringe model from false to true
-- Included a configuration for SuprimeCam_200808 using SDFRED preprocessed images
-- Explicitly setting WEIGHT_TYPE to MAP_WEIGHT for swarp
-- Setting cross_id radius to 10.0*pixscale if pixelscale is less than 0.2"
-- Iterating the mode estimation in create_norm_para.sh once, such that large 
   vignetted areas are excluded from the statistics (threshold = 0.25*mode_initial)
-- renamed IMACS2@LCO to IMACS_F4@LCO
-- introduced IMACS_F2@LCO


v2.3.8 (2011-07-18)

-- Expanded get_wcs() in bash.include: if no cd-matrix is present and
   CDELTi/j is set to a value equal or larger than 1, then use the
   native pixel scale in order to reconstruct the cd-matrix (some old
   EFOSC data require this)
-- Added a 2x2 binned version for the old EFOSC camera
-- Renamed EFOSC2@3.6m to EFOSC2@ESO3.6m
-- The Stetson catalog does not contain u-band magnitudes.
   Absphotom module adjusted correspondingly.
-- Added a MEGAPRIME_ELIXIR configuration


v2.3.7 (2011-07-03)

-- Removed the tiff and fftw source packages from the distribution.
   They might as well be considered as prerequisites.
-- small layout fixes in the 'create splitting script' section
-- changed the default from 'astrometrix' to 'scamp' when the
   gui is launched the first time
-- set MOSAIC_TYPE to SAME_CRVAL if a multi-chip camera is selected
   and the scamp parameter configuration opened the first time for
   a new log file
-- Updated the splitting script for the MOSAIC-II configurations
   (could crash if RA keyword was non-existent)
-- Added a 2x2 binning configuration for MOSAIC-II@CTIO (8 ports)
-- Updated the default orientation of PISCES@LBT
-- The 'animation' dialogue would not work with multi-chip camera data. Fixed.
-- Moved a scamp warning to the 'ignore' list
-- Fixed a bug in astromphotom: coordinates would not be copied into
   fits headers if requested (introduced in 2.3.6).
-- The reset button next to the logfile name now also resets all values
   in the parameter dialogue to their default values


v2.3.6 (2011-06-22)

-- This version of theli-gui is only compatible with theli-1.5.1
-- Print warning in colour dialogue if no reference sources for 
   photometric colour calibration were downloaded
-- Another stabilisation of guessing the filter when coadd is called
   without explicit configuration
-- Upon launch, check if ${HOME}/.qt is owned by root. If yes,
   print a warning and leave.
-- Added ° and ^ to the list of "bad characters" in section_pre.h
-- Fixed a bug in the splitting script (removal of bad characters 
   in EQUINOX keyword)
-- Added ": not found" to the error scanner
-- Added "too many arguments" to the error scanner
-- Added "null or negative global weighting factor" to the error scanner
-- Updated dcraw to v9.08
-- Updated libtiff to v3.9.5
-- Updated wcstools to v3.8.3
-- Fixed a mean bug in the 'scamp' scripts. If images were called
   e.g. "image.fits" and "ximage.fits", then searching catalog lists
   would not return unambiguous results as 'image.fits' also matches
   'ximage.fits' as a search string. This is probably the cause for
   the 'not all science images have headers' error during coaddition.
-- Fixed a bug in splitsuprimecam.c (overscan correction was not 
   performed correctly; some improvements to avoid dark banding 
   through bright stars near the readout edges)
-- Showing error log: emacs and nedit jump directly to the error line
-- Distort value could be set to zero (invalid). Limited range to [1...9]
-- Misc: Absolute zeropoint: do not show error log if no ref sources found
   but display a message box instead.
-- Fixed a small bug in create_stats_table.sh; script would not exit
   if an internal error occured.
-- Small speed-up in create_stats_table.sh by explicitly exiting 
   nested loop once match is found
-- The user can add two comma-separated FILTER keywords for the splitting 
   script. The resulting FILTER keyword will be written as 
   FILTER1+FILTER2
-- Splitting script: if the values are given as DIT,NDIT, images will be 
   rescaled accordingly and the exposure time keyword written as DIT*NDIT
-- Fixed a (rare) bug in update_coadd_header.sh (gawk would not recognise
   a FS string if a '+' sign was embedded; gawk replaced by sed)
-- "Stabilised" the function check_fileexistence() (it only tested chip #1
   and would not jump to the next chip if the first chip was missing, e.g.
   if the user moved them into a parking directory). I'm now sequentially 
   testing for all chips
-- The native pixel scale in the coadd config is always displayed,
   to avoid confusion with instruments for which the pixel scale is
   interchangable.
-- If the 'same weight for all pixels' checkbox was checked, the parameter 
   fields below were not disabled upon reopening the dialog.
-- When creating a reference catalogue from an image, a ds9 and skycat copy
   would not be saved into the corresponding cat/ds9cat and cat/skycat
   directories (for convenience only, as scamp takes the catalog from 
   ~/.theli/scripts/)
-- Fixed a rare bug in create_stats_table.sh and create_scampcats.sh, which 
   would cause a truncation of catalog names if the string "fits" was present 
   within the name of the exposure, e.g. image_xxxfitsyyy.fits
-- Suppressed a warning message in latest gcc compilers (checkbox array
   could actually have been used uninitialised; explains why sometimes
   the absolute-path-warning did not kick in)
-- The user cannot enter a NFRAMES value higher than the one determined
   automatically.
-- Print a warning if the coadd outlier threshold is lower than 3.0
-- Replaced extimg[] by ext_img[]; could explain some very rare hickups
   with the processing status
-- Fixed some potentially failing link creations if multi-chip camera data
   is spread over several harddisks
-- Made the blocksize for swarpfilter variable from within 
   resample_filtercosmics.sh. The scaling factor is purely based on empirics.
-- When coordinates are entered in astrom/photom, then the user has the
   option of choosing whether CRVALi only, or CRVALi and CDi_j are overwritten,
   or if nothing gets overwritten. The 'cancel' option has been removed. 
-- Added global mask for the 4 HAWKI@VLT detectors
-- Expanded the message box in zp.ui.h if no overlap is found
-- zp.ui.h points to the previously opened directory if several images
   are calibrated in a row 
-- Splitting script for HAWKI inserts filter name into file name
-- Added GMOS-S .ahead file (possibly 90 degrees rotated from default PA)
-- Redefined GMOS-S detectors (overscan and trimming regions were wrong)
-- Changed the way how the ACAM filter keyword is constructed. Turned out 
   the ACAMFILT keyword was unreliable (who would have thought...)
-- Updated the SOFI splitting script
-- Included NICI@GEMINI_SOUTH
-- Included SOI@SOAR
-- Included SPARTAN@SOAR
-- Included GOODMAN@SOAR 1x1 and 2x2 binned versions
-- Included PISCES@LBT


v2.3.5 (2011-03-23)

-- Included WFI@SSO_40inch
-- Expanded fitscollapse such that x and y collapse correction can be
   done in one go; corresponding change in the GUI


v2.3.4 (2011-03-14)

-- Added 'Operation not permitted' to the error scanner
   (occurs when creating links on an external disk which doesn't have
   its permissions set correctly)
-- Included Carsten's process monitor; needs some more work and better 
   integration, but at least the main bolts are in place.
-- Selecting bin=1 in the preview task would result in empty tiff files
-- The fitsbin programme would return an empty image if binsize=1;
   exiting in this case with an error
-- Expanding the error messages
-- Making the automatic filter guess (if coaddition is started without 
   configuration) more stable
-- Replaced ':' by '-' in the color_theli_backup_<date> folder such that
   it can be read by windows
-- Updated fitsdemosaicbayer (edge interpolation).
-- Catching an error during splitting if an RA/DEC keyword is not present
   AND if decimal conversion has been requested
-- "Restore ORIG:" preserving ds9 region masks in the progress, either
   individual files or those already processed and stored in a separate 
   .reg directory.
-- Extended error checking in create_stdphotom.sh and create_abs_photo_info.sh
-- Included a 2x2 binned version of WFC@INT


v2.3.3 (2011-01-27)

-- Fixed an issue with the splitting script generation caused
   in 2.3.2.


v2.3.2 (2011-01-25)

-- Included LORRI@NewHorizons
-- Copying the (incomplete) WCS information from WFI@MPGESO raw data
   was broken in the splitting script (when introducing support for 
   arbitrary rotation angles)
-- Fixed an issue with renaming images to a certain FITS keyword
   (the script syntax did not work)
-- The function that renames images to the value of an arbitrarily 
   chosen FITS keyword was corrupted
-- Checking if the number of characters of a raw FITS file name is larger 
   than 60. In this case a STOP message is printed upon attempting to split 
   the images. Long file names are truncated in FITS table headers leading to
   incompletely propagated information.
-- The 'distribute target sets' was also separating standard star fields.
   This is not wanted, as the absolute photometry module runs on all
   standard star fields sequentially.
-- Parameter configuration: The automated skyposition angle estimation
   and the astrometry mosaic_type readme buttons were deactivated
   (happened in 2.3.0)
-- Replacing swarp1 with swarp2 in the preparation of the coaddition
   broke the optional choice of selecting a different sky position angle 
   (as the CDELT1/2 keywords are no longer present in the output header)
-- Sometimes the 'use dark' checkbox would not be shown upon startup; fixed.



v2.3.1 (2011-01-21)

-- added 'keyword out of range' to the error scanner
-- set NTHREADS from 0 to 1 in create_coadd_swarp2.conf
   (NTHREADS=0 (automatic) would not be understood, even though
   the keyword is reset in the resampling/coaddition script)
-- The archive of v 2.3.0 was corrupted (contained two backup versions
   of  scripts instead of the current version).
-- theli.cpp was not yet compatible with /bin/dash (previously running
   instance would not be closed upon launching a second instance)


v2.3.0 (2011-01-18)

-- This version is only compatible with theli-1.4.1
-- Removed old documentation PDFs from the distribution and the 
   internal help section; documentation.h was merged with theliform.h
-- Removed swarp-2.19 from the gui package as it is contained in theli-1.4
-- The preparation of the coaddition is done with swarp2
-- Changed the routine that reads the filter keyword. It starts with chip
   1, and if no such images are found, proceeds to the next chip, including
   sky subtracted images if no unsubtracted images are found. This reduces
   the waiting time significantly for large multi-chip cameras.
-- Added a check for file existence in all fitstools programmes
-- Updated dcraw to v9.05
-- If no reference RA and DEC coordinates are specified, the median of the 
   image centers is used instead of CRVAL1 CRVAL2 of the first image in the
   list. If only certain chips of a mosaic were stacked, the coadded image
   often was empty as RA DEC were significantly offset.
-- Separated the absolute photometry module into two independent tasks
-- If only one filter is present, theli does not automatically load the
   coadd config dialog but determines the filter string in the background.
-- Removed old unused code from the source
-- Appending the character 'P' to the processing status string was done
   independent of the chosen absolute photometry method; fixed.
-- Added optional coadd image size parameters (for very wide angle
   projections, the automatically determined size is often badly matched)
-- Replaced MEGAPRIME@CFHT.ahead. In the old one, the CRPIX2 values were
   reversed (origin unknown).
-- Found out that system() sends its arguments to "/bin/sh -c", therefore
   creating problems on Linuxes which have /bin/sh linked to /bin/dash.
   Reason for 'sh: syntax error: bad fd number' is that dash does not 
   understand the ">&" redirection, however it does understand " > file 2>&1", 
   which is equivalent.
-- Suppress an error message if the NEXTDUMMY keyword is not written into
   resampled images (happens sporadically, reason unknown, uncritical)
-- Fixed a small bug in statistics.sh, which could prevent the creation of 
   the checkplots in rare cases
-- Flat fields with colour chips are 'normequalised', i.e. all pixels 
   belonging to the same colour are brought to a mean level of one.
   In this way we avoid artificially increased values of one colour
   channel if it is significantly underrepresented in the flat field,
   e.g. the red channel in a blue twilight flat. If the background level
   was close to saturation values, object detection could fail.
-- For colour cameras the normequalised flat is used for the global weight 
   instead of the debayered green channel
-- Debiased and flat-fielded, but undebayered colour images are not stored
   anymore.


v2.2.5 (2010-12-01)

-- Included MOSAIC-I_old@KPNO_0.9m   (old=config before Aug 2010)
-- Included MOSAIC-I_old@KPNO_4.0m   (old=config before Aug 2010)
-- Included NEWFIRM@CTIO
-- Fixed a bug in the automatic guess routine for camera configuration
   (affected multi-chip cameras only)
-- Fixed a bug introduced with the HH MM SS format in the splitting script
   in v2.2.4


v2.2.4 (2010-11-28)

-- Using 'statvfs' to determine available disk space.
-- Coadd: The minimum size of a cluster of bad pixels was always
   smaller by 1 than the value specified. Fixed.
-- Small changes to the photometric colour calibration script.
-- Changed all /bin/sh to /bin/bash in cdsclient
-- Removed warning if /bin/sh is linked to /bin/dash;
   Not sure if this problem is finally solved. Time will show.
-- Automatic renaming of 'scamp.exe' to 'scamp' upon startup. Some 
   browsers automatically append the .exe suffix if the file is 
   recognised as executable.
-- Replaced all statistics sections by the actual image size of each
   chip. Thus different chip geometries can be handled without making the
   instrument config unnecessarily complicated.
-- The splitting script will now handle RA and DEC in formats
   HH MM SS and DD MM SS in addition to HH:MM:SS and DD:MM:SS
-- Changed some red information text to green colour 
   (if splitted data were found)
-- Added the get_statminsection() function to bash.include
-- Added 'list has not enough members' to the error scanner (preprocess)
-- Removed an old and invalid configuration for MOSAIC-I@KPNO
-- Added MOSAIC-II@CTIO (3 configurations)
-- Added GMOS@GEMINI-NORTH
-- Added NIRI@GEMINI-NORTH
-- Added GMOS@GEMINI-SOUTH


v2.2.3 (2010-10-27)

-- Fixed a bug in calculating the reference coordinates for
   the download catalog if the input images crossed the RA = 360...0
   border.
-- Updated getstats.c such that the median would (optionally) not be 
   averaged if the number of input data points is even. Needed for
   the RA=360...0 crossing.
-- Modified 'lst' such that it accepts DATE-OBS as input
-- Catching an coadd init error which appears when the user launches
   the coaddition without checking the configuration first (in this
   case the filter list would be empty, and hence theli does not know
   which filter should be stacked). Theli will load the config dialog
   for the user in this case after displaying an info panel.
-- Download of the reference catalog at specified coordinates would not 
   work if the main and/or science directory were empty.
-- Smoothing overlap regions during coaddition was not working if data
   from different cameras (and different image sizes) was combined.
-- Replaced the check_rawfilename.sh script by an internal C-routine;
   the script did not catch things such as leading or trailing empty 
   characters.
-- Removing metacharacters from FITS keyword values if 'getkey' is called
   with 'clean' as the last argument.


v2.2.2 (2010-10-18)

-- Added the option to use header information only for astrometry
-- Modified create_stats_table such that it doesn't produce an
   error message if no catalogs are encountered (if the fits header
   is used as an astrometrical header)
-- Added 'command not found' to the error scanner. Most likely caused
   if the bindir is not included in the PATH variable.
-- The 'close' and 'abort' button in the animate respectively statistics
   dialogs were not connected.
-- The seeing units in the statistics table were not updated if the
   table was empty
-- Renamed all 'Quit' buttons to 'Close', for homogeneity
-- Included OSIRIS@GTC
-- Including the removal of non-numeric characters from the equinox 
   keyword when creating splitting scripts on the fly.
-- Exit splitting script for DSLR RAW data if TIFF images could not be 
   created (probably due to a missing link to libtiff.so.3). Print
   an error message with according instructions.
-- Load the filter list for coadd-config only if the param dialog is brought
   up during coaddition, or if the user switches from inside to the
   coaddition param page (avoiding unnecessary long loading times).
-- Aborting the installer script if python version is older than 2.4, 
   or 3.0 or later.
-- Generalised installer script; some stabilisations
-- Updated tab order in parameter dialog
-- Updated pyfits from v2.2.2 to v2.3.1


v2.2.1 (2010-10-09)

-- Forcing DCRAW to not rotate images by 90 degrees if gravity sensor
   in the DSLR is switched on.
-- Suppressing warning messages in install.sh if WIFIX was not installed
-- The overscan area estimate could become negative. 
-- An overscan will only be recognised if it is broader than 5 pixels.
-- Removing non-numeric characters from equinox keyword in existing 
   raw data splitting scripts


v2.2.0 (2010-10-05)

-- This version is compatible with theli-1.3.0
-- Changed the message text displayed when splitting is attempted and
   master calibration files are already present.
-- In some awk constructs comparisons between 'numeric' strings and 
   integers were made, which works for integers, but it could
   fail in rare cases for floats. Seven scripts were affected;
   now doing purely numeric comparisons in these cases.
-- Seeing determination: preanisotropy can fail catastrophically
   in some cases, returning inverted lower and upper limits. In this
   case the seeing is determined from all objects. This did not lead to
   errors with earlier versions as it was caught by another 'if' condition, 
   however now I check earlier for such a failure.
-- Splitting script: reading EXPOSURE keyword if EXPTIME is not found
   (only for instruments created with gui-2.2.0 or later, pre-defined
   splitting scripts are NOT changed), and the other way round
-- Print a warning if the instrument for the splitting script dialog
   could not be identified automatically.
-- Added an internal check to see if the INSTRUMENT variable in the
   instrument.ini file has the same value as the name of the instrument.ini
   file (without the suffix). If configuration files are manually renamed,
   then this could result in inconsistencies. INSTRUMENT is forced to
   have the same name as the file if a difference is encountered.
-- Changed the horizontal alignment of the radius and magnitude lineedits
   for the reference catalog
-- Removed all traces from 'transform images' from the code.
-- Direct photometric calibration for individual chips got the file 
   extension "P"
-- Small cosmetic adjustments in install.sh
-- Expanded the absolute photometry STOP messages a bit
-- Running sextractor+eye for identifications of cosmics, the 
   CHECKIMAGE_TYPE was set to SEGMENTATION instead of OBJECTS. With an
   excessive amount of hot pixels (about 100000+), this resulted in negative
   values which were not filtered out, hence partial masking was the outcome.
   I set it to OBJECTS.
-- Redirecting stderr of 'du' and 'df' to /dev/null to avoid
   irritating runtime warnings when a lot of temporary files are being 
   deleted.
-- Added "Illegal instruction" to the list of error messages.
   It is (probably) caused by running an AMD scamp executable on an
   Intel architecture, or the other way round.
-- Several modifications in the creation of the splitting script:
   * changed the FITS keyword processing for colour CCDs from RAW scheme
     to FITS scheme how it should have been in first place
   * removed checks for "KEY_N/A" for non-existent keys (empty string 
     returned by 'getkey')
   * some code cleaning
-- Automatic cross-id estimation was performed upon re-opening the parameter
   dialogue, and the previous user setting was lost. The user-entered value
   is now kept unless all parameters are 'reset'.
-- Default value for crossid_radius was always "2" instead of the 
   automatically estimated value
-- Updated cdsclient to version 3.6
-- Added the PPMXL reference catalogue
-- Added 'segmentation fault' to the error scanner (was already there, but 
   only with an uppercase 'S')
-- Introduced additional distortion-groups, -degrees and -keys for scamp
-- Dumping a copy of the scamp output to plots/scamp.log
-- Added the option to automatically estimate the sky position angle
-- Replaced a few strndup() calls in the fitstools by standard code.
   strndup() is a GNU C extension and didn't compile under MacOs.
-- Checking that CRVAL1 and CRVAL2 are identical in the coadded images
   if they are run through the "crop maximum overlap" step of the colour
   dialogue.
-- Removed the 'crop maximum overlap' button in the colour dialog.
   This has to be done anyway, therefore this task can already be 
   done while fetching the coadded images. The latter are not copied
   anymore but just linked, the links are deleted after cropping took 
   place. Significant speed improvment if files are very large.
-- Removed some deprecated information from the online help ('what's this')
   in the splitting script dialogue.
-- Some code cleanup concerning parameter configuration files
-- Removed from the 'edit' menu the actions to edit progs.ini and
   configuration files in gui/reduction. These should be left unchanged.
-- progs.ini contained a copy of the NPARA variable that wasn't used 
   anymore. I deleted it to avoid confusion.
-- Copies of param_set1 and param_set2 still existed in the 'scripts'
   directory. Deleted to avoid confusion.
-- Updated WIFIX to v2.3.1
-- The Help section accidentally loaded an old version of the documentation.
-- Checking the format of reference coordinates only when 'get catalog'
   or 'start' is pressed
-- Changed the status of the message box shown for wrong coordinate formats
   from 'critical' to 'warning', and updated its text.
-- Superflatting, weighting, astromphotom, coaddition:
   Checking if the image extension does not start with "OFC".
   In rare cases (reason unknown) it can happen that information about it 
   is lost, and then the extension is an empty string, corrupting the 
   script syntax. The user is asked to update the reduction status.
   Also makes the GUI more foolproof for newbies.
-- Replaced the 'update fits header with zeroorder astrometric solution'
   checkbox with a push button in the main dialog. Hence astrometry doesn't 
   need to be run twice, and it also works for wifix. The original header 
   is saved and can be restored.
-- Added QHY9, EOS450D
-- Calling 'preprocess' with default configuration file to suppress
   a warning message
-- zp.ui.h and combineimages.ui.h were using 'emacs' statically
   as an editor to display error logs. Changed to the editor currently
   selected in the main dialog window.
-- Erasing the checkbox of 'create source cat' when the configure button
   is pressed.
-- Added "Cannot map " to the error triggering list
-- create_stats_table.sh: a gawk command would return incomplete results
   if metacharacters were present in the directory path
-- Dark rescaling: remove mode of the dark as zero-order bias correction
   (direct subtraction of a bias would result in increased noise)
-- Modified the statistics section significantly. Creates some basic
   plots showing background, seeing, RZP and airmass trends.
-- Added an image analyser to 'miscellaneous'
-- If the coadd ref coordinates are empty, and those for astrom/photom
   are not, then copy the latter into the coadd configuration
-- Running a small script before the splitting script that replaces
   blanks and certain metacharacters in file names with underscores
-- Checking if files that run through the image splitter are already
   present when image splitting is attempted. If yes, a red warning
   message is printed.
-- Printing a STOP message if files with extension XXX are not
   present before processing starts.
-- Updating the command list after a redo button was pressed
-- Pressing a redo button did not remove the corresponding entry form
   the processing status array; fixed.
-- correct_crval_para.sh: CD12 and CD21 were not forced to be zero.
   normally no problem, unless a cd matrix with non-zero rotation 
   angle was already present.
   also, it was only checked if the signs of CD11 and CD12 were consistent
   with north up east left, but not their consistency with the pixelscale.
   If a wrong header was inserted at some point, these values would not be
   reset to their correct ones. Doing it from scratch starting with the 
   native pixel scale.
-- Worked around a bizarre globbing problem in bash in the statistics 
   and image analysis module. The '*' in a command line argument would be 
   expanded (or not) depending on whether the result exists or not.
   Writing the name filter into a exported string variable that is then read
   from within the scripts.
-- Removed all traces of the 'process all' and 'kill all' processing schemes   
-- Removed about a dozen actions contained in the .ui file but not
   implemented anywhere in the GUI (bad 'designer' code handling)
-- The syntax of 'getkey' in the get_wcs function was wrong (used for
   splitting images). Affected only images with non-zero rotation matrix.
   Replaced 'getkey' with 'dfits' a this part has to access fits extensions.
-- Fixed a bug with correct_crval.sh. If coordinates were entered and the
   user answered 'no' (does not want coords to be copied to fits headers)
   it could happen that they were nevertheless written to the header depending
   whether the parameter file has been written at that time or not.
   Workaround: the correct_crval script is deleted internally from the
   command list if the user answers 'no'.
-- Added automatic estimate of camera chip geometries to the instrument
   creation dialogue.
-- Wrote a python version of 'preanisotropy' that estimates the stellar
   locus and its width based on a gaussian fitted to the rh diagramme.
-- Changed the 'album' syntax to reflect changes in theli-1.3.0
-- Updated get_coadd_zp.sh, which was relying on the presence of the
   CDELT keywords in the header. It now also works with CDij, and uses 
   a default radius if neither can be found (in which case the header is 
   most likely corrupt and the matching will fail anyway).
-- Removed the 'numarray' package from the distribution. Python scripts
   are entirely based on 'numpy' (and 'scipy').
-- Writing the colour calibration factors into a COLORFAC keyword in the
   *_2tiff.fits images
-- Made a scamp parameter configuration warning more explicit.
-- Updated tool tip texts in parameters.ui
-- The binned preview checkbox was accidentally painted green when the
   globalweight task was executed.
-- Killed several bugs in get_wcs from bash.include that became 'alive'
   with this gui version.
-- Fixed the syntax of the globalweight script (was wrong if the science
   directory was left empty)
-- Create_norm_para.sh: set pixels to zero if they are below the threshold,
   instead of setting them to the threshold.
-- Updated swarp to 2.19.6
-- Updated dcraw to 9.04
-- Leave automatic sky modelling active when constant sky is selected
   (the detection thresholds are still used, unless the sky is modified
   individually)
-- Separated the master dark processing from the master bias processing.
   It has its own task now, and avoids certain lock-ups of GUI, e.g. if
   a master bias is copied from elsewhere but a dark should still be
   calculated.
-- The nlow/nhigh rejection can be adjusted for dark frames separately.
-- Renamed "Debiasing + flatfielding data" to "Calibrating data". More 
   consistent with what is actually happening.
-- Forcing a "_stiff.tif" suffix if luminance channels are converted
   to TIFF using stiff. So far, this was only done for RGB images.
-- Extracted the 'movie' section from the colour dialogue and made it
   a separate 'miscellaneous' action.
-- Made a dirty hack for WFC@INT headers, moving the reference pixel 
   and coordinates onto the optical axis, assuming standard orientation.
   That resolves a problem with scamp requiring much larger search
   radii han necessary. However, data with non-standard orientations
   (i.e. taken before 2005) will have headers messed up probably even 
   more.
-- Removed the online catalog filtering for PPXML since not all magnitudes
   are present for different fields, which would result in an empty catalog
   being returned. Filtering is done after the catalog was downloaded.
-- Introduced the possibility to smoothly blend the edges of overlapping 
   areas in a mosaic. To this end the edges of the weight maps are multiplied
   with a cosine profile.
-- Iterative seeing convolution. It still does not deliver as accurate
   results as desired, but it's definitely better than previously.
-- Replaced the Gaussian filter for the smoothing of a fringe frame
   by a median filter, which is insensitive with respect to hot or cold
   pixels.
-- Limited the fgroup radius to its maximum of 180 degrees
-- Included an allsky version of the GSC limited to mag=10; This avoids
   problems with downloading extremely wide fields from CDS, which often
   yielded incomplete sky coverage.
-- Stripping possible 'B' and 'J' strings from the EQUINOX keyword
   in the splitting scripts, as 'mefsplit' wants a purely numeric value.
-- Made the origin of the diskspace warnings more clear. The popup window
   did not say it originated from THELI.
-- Added the possibility to create a superflat without object detection.
   Useful for the first pass near-IR background estimation. Simply leave
   one of the detection threshold fields empty.
-- Replaced FORS2_2CCD@VLT.ahead; the old one had a significant non-zero
   rotation angle
-- Added two exit conditions to create_absphotom_coadd.sh and 
   create_stats_table.sh
-- No DARK rescaling attempted if the DARK does not contain a EXPTIME keyword
-- Backuping current processing status images in a separate directory
   if a 'Redo'-button is pressed (in previous versions they were left 
   were they were)
-- Doing a 'redo' task now erases all previously done steps from the
   status string and clears the corresponding check boxes. This was not
   handled very cleanly previously.
-- Added a 'Select dir' button to the color dialogue
-- The status string and the GUI status were not set correct when using
   a dynamic superflat. Introduced when separating the calibration
   step into two independent flatfielding and superflatting scripts.
-- Added 'integer expression expected' to the error scanner
-- Create_astromcats_para.sh and update_coadd_header.sh: replaced an
   invalid float comparison introduced recently by a string comparison
-- Fixed four huge bugs in the near-IR dynamic superflatting process.
   Some of them introduced recently, others might have been there much 
   longer. Anyway, sky subtraction with this mode is very significantly 
   improved now.
-- Forcing at least 6 sources for seeing determination with preanisotropy
   after size and magnitude filtering.
-- Avoiding a rounding issue with ldacfilter and the seeing determination if
   only very few sources are left. If they are closer than 1e-4 to one of 
   the limits, then they are not recognised by ldacfilter anymore. Adding
   a 0.01 margin as a work-around.
-- create_stats_table.sh would crash if a SEEING keyword was already
   present in the header because the splitting script copied it from the
   raw data. Skipping this step if this happens (affected: HAWKI, VIRCAM, 
   LBC_RED, LBC_BLUE)
-- The astrometric reference catalog can now also be retrieved if
   the science dir does not exist, or no images are present, provided that
   coordinates have been entered for ra and dec instead of requesting them
   from FITS headers ("from header" or empty string)
-- Renamed 'processinggroup_xx.h' to 'section_xx.h'
-- STOP if the splitting script cannot be found.
-- Stripping possible white space or carriage returns etc from the reference 
   coordinates. Even though the validator does not allow these characters to 
   be entered manually, they can slip in through copy&paste actions and then
   break the syntax.
-- Fixed a bug in fitscubeslicer
-- Update and small bugfixing in install.sh
-- Removed 'NATIVE' from the celestial type combo box as the input data is
   always equatorial in THELI
-- Updating the reference coordinate text label depending on which celestial
   type is chosen, such that the input coordinate system becomes clear
-- If no flag images are present (due to data reduced with older theli 
   versions), adding (N)IMAFLAGS_ISO keywords to the source catalogs for
   compatibility reasons (OBJECTS table would not be copied by ldacconv).


v2.1.8 (2010-07-07)

-- Fixed a harmless bug in create_scamp.sh (led to a warning but without
   further consequences)
-- Introduced an optional minimum number of objects to be kept for an 
   image/catalog in order for that image to make it into astrometry.
-- Small change in create_astromcats_para.sh to suppress 'no such file 
   or directory' warning by 'du' (triggered by deleted temporary files)
-- The resampling script has a 'error' string in a comment line which
   triggered the error scanner (introduced in 2.1.7)
-- Rewrote fitscut.c using qfits_loadpix_window() which is much faster
-- Increased the maximum of the minimum number of masked pixels in 
   swarpfilter.c from 5 to 9.
-- Resampling a subset of chips from multi-chip cameras on a multi-core 
   CPU resulted in an exit from the script (introduced in 2.1.7).
-- Printing the GUI version into the logfiles (GUIVERSION parameter)
-- Included gpcfitsmask in fitstools.c
-- Homogeneised the internal storage of background pixmaps.
   Like that different skin can be developed by 3rd parties
-- Fixed the automatic guessing of the angle required to rotate an image
   such that it appears 'unrotated' after coaddition (for skyposangle != 0);
   If the CD matrix is sufficiently non-orthogonal such that the RA and DEC
   axes fall in only two cartesian quadrants, then no value is estimated.


v2.1.7 (2010-07-01)

-- Fixed a syntax error in update_coadd_header.sh; it wouldn't exit
   if chips.cat5 didn't exist
-- Checking if catalogs actually contain objects after filtering,
   otherwise seeing calculation will produce an error
   (update_coadd_header.sh, create_astromcats_para.sh)
-- Fixed the splitting script for GPC1 (cosmics were not detected due to
   presence of NANed pixels)
-- Added ASTREF_WEIGHT to the list of parameters configurable for scamp
-- Fixed resample_coadd_swarp.sh; if a subset of chips was selected for
   the stacking, and more than one processor used, then too many threads
   were launched processing identical data sets.
-- Automatically adjusted crossid radius; if the pixel scale is less than 
   0.7, crossid is fixed to 2.0 arcsec; if the pixel scale is larger than 
   0.7, then crossid = 2.5 * pixscale
-- Made the 'Transform images task' invisible for the time being; I think
   it is not needed anymore.
-- Added SPLIT_IMAGES to the 'delete' menu
-- Scanning all chips instead of just CCD #1 for filter names (coadd config)
-- Removed a mmep runtime error from resample_coadd_swarp.sh (if the user
   has removed some chips from a mosaic camera entirely)



v2.1.6 (2010-06-28)

-- Added error, rms and number of objects to zp.ui.h, and err and rms to
   create_photillcorr_getzp.sh; modified fitspic.c accordingly.
-- Removed a warning in get_coadd_zp (empty line in makessc config)
-- Removed a runtime warning printed by 'du' to the command line while
   creating source catalogs (could not find ds9 catalog constituents
   because they were deleted already)
-- Added an optional argument 'clean' to getkey which deletes metacharacters
   in a keyword
-- Added a new parallelised pan-starrs splitting script (gpc1_para_start.sh);
   It runs the weighting process at the same time;
-- Added the 'clean' argument to all splitting scripts when the FILTER
   keyword is probed. Modified cni_form.ui.h accordingly.
-- Cleaned up warning messages from the coaddition scripts
-- Exit from update_coadd_header.sh if chips.cat5 does not exist
-- Fixed a bug in processinggroup_ap.h: A decimal ".0" would be appended
   to reference coordinates even if a decimal point was already present
   (introduced in 2.0.0)
-- Check if after preanisotropy sources are left before running ldacfilter
   to avoid unnecessary error messages (create_astromcats_para.sh and
   update_coadd_header.sh)
-- Replaced 'awk' by ${P_GAWK} in several reduction scripts
-- Modified create_scampcats.sh such that it creates scamp catalogs only
   for those images that are currently present in the SCIENCE directory
-- Removed the calculation of the reference pixel from 'getmaxoverlap.sh'
   as this is done already internally in 'fitscut'.
-- Included EOS1000D and Apogee U9000 in the list of commercial instruments
-- Fixed a typo in create_wifix.sh (maxdepth -1 instead of maxdepth 1)



v2.1.5 (2010-06-10)

-- Merged the astrometrix and wifix scripts into create_wifix.sh
-- Updated create_wifix.sh to theli-1.1.1 standards (replaced perl call)
-- Fixed several bugs with offtarget processing in the superflatting 
   and astrometry sections (a STOP message was printed without need,
   and at one place the science directory was used instead of offtarget)
-- Moved the download of the reference catalog to the astrometry call
-- Theli checks before the gui launch if scamp exists; 
   if yes, it checks if the binary is executable; 
   if not, it tries to make it executable;
   if that fails, a message is printed and exit
-- Rewrote the part in theli.cpp that checks for the presence of 
   /bin/sh -> /bin/dash
   There were a few syntax errors in the message that could confuse
   users (missing / in path names)
-- Significant code simplifications in all processinggroup_xx.h
-- Removed 3 unneeded functions from functions.h
-- update_coadd_header.sh: FILTER keyword was not always written as a 
   string (enclosed in ' ')
-- Deleting a series of metacharacters in the FILTER keyword without
   replacement. They could lead to confusion in prepare_coadd.sh and 
   update_coadd_header.sh as they where expanded by the shell
-- Adding an additional filter to create_astromcats (filter out everything 
   with flux_radius smaller than 0.5*min_fwhm)
-- If preanisotropy fails for the seeing measurement, the value 0.0
   is written (for FWHM_IMAGE, FLUX_RADIUS), both in create_astromcats_para.sh 
   and update_coadd_header.sh
-- Updated the pixel scale for Omega2000@CAHA to 0.449"/pixel
-- Fixed process_split_ALFOSC@NOT.sh



v2.1.4 (2010-06-07)

-- the colour calibration dialog was corrupted in several places
-- Fixed album_GPC1@PS1 (chips where misplaced)
-- fitsbin.c: if more than half of the pixels entering a binned
   pixel are NaN, then the output pixel is NaN, too.
-- Inverting GPC1 science images into weight maps for splitting
-- Included fitsnanmask.c in fitstools (for pan-starrs)
-- direct ZP comparison with 2mass or sdss would result in a correction
   factor of zero in case of no overlap. In this case the correction
   is not performed.
-- Sorting the input catalog list for create_photillcorr_getZP.sh
-- Removed a warning triggered by an empty line in PIC_makessc.conf
-- Modified absolute direct photometric calibration with mosaic cameras
   such that it would also run if some chips are not covered by the
   reference catalogue
-- Updated the pre-defined splitting script for the EOS400D
-- The update_coadd_header.sh script would produce an error if the
   FILTER string starts with a numeric character. Prepending PREFIX_
   fixes this. Probably not the final solution, but fine for the 
   moment.
-- create_scamp.sh looks explicitly for OFCx catalogs matching the extension
   of the images (for single-chip cameras). Previously, it took all
   catalogs which could result in confusion if catalogs were created for
   different processing statuses.
-- update_coadd_header.sh would not correctly identify the FILTER keyword
   if different filters were present in SCIENCE
-- Suppress an "error occurred in the calling script" message, triggered if
   the directory from which theli was started has been deleted in the 
   meantime;



v2.1.3 (2010-05-27)

-- Replace "/" by "_" in the FILTER keyword (coadd_ID);
   Modified prepare_coadd_swarp.sh accordingly;
-- Absorb some error messages in the absolute photometry module
-- Coadd filter: only appended to ident string if more than one
   filter is present
-- Fixed a small bug in the parameter configuration. The coadd filter
   string would be written as (null) if this part hadn't been configured
   yet, which was choked upon by other parts of the code. Replaced it
   with an empty string.
-- Fixed a 'while' construct that could possibly run forever (in reality:
   core dump) in fitsbloomdetect.c
-- The seeing [arcsec] in the header of coadd.fits was wrong if the image
   was resampled to a different pixel scale
-- Included superflat in the defect detection (analoguous to normalised flats)
-- Removed some warnings from create_globalweights_para.sh
-- Obtain COADDZP from chips_phot.cat5
-- Modified create_scamp.sh such that for standard star fields scamp
   would download its reference catalogues instead of using locally defined
   ones (the latter would not work if different standard star fields were 
   provided (-> average coordinates))
-- Small changes in the output format of fitspic.c
-- Fixed a bug in absphotom mode when comparing fluxes directly to SDSS
   or 2MASS: the wrong filter was downloaded (the corresponding parameter was
   unintentionally reset to the first in the combobox)
-- Fixed the Subaru splitting scripts once more
-- Suppressing error in update_coadd_header if no absphotom info available
-- Fixed the number of lines read in one go by swarpfilter to 100 until
   memory consumption is better understood.
-- Removed the '-static' compiler option (swarpfilter), as it would not
   compile under fedora
-- The compilation of 'stiff' did not look for a local libtiff installation
-- Fixed two wrongly names variables in create_astromcats, which could
   result in slightly underestimated seeing values
-- Fixed the sextractor configuration for get_variables.sh. I deactivated
   the creation of a catalog in the corresponding conf.sex to speed up
   some other processes.
-- Bug fixing in create_scamp.sh, create_abs_photo_info.sh and 
   update_coadd_header.sh concerning absolute photometry
-- Removed the FLAT_SCALEIMAGE parameter from process_science_para.sh 
   (it was present twice, without any adverse effect)
-- Removed the AUTOMATIC setting for abs. photometry. It isn't suitable
   for GUI data reduction, as the user still has to make a choice at some 
   point later on. Hence we go with interactive mode right away.
-- Using vizquery instead of findnomad1 and findsdss7 in the colour	
   calibration; there were inconsistencies with the latter programmes
-- Added a server list for the download to color_form.ui.h and zp.ui.h
-- Small layout changes to the zp gui
-- Direct photometric zp determination was reading from non-existent FITS 
   keyword
-- The 'abort' button in zp.ui.h wasn't linked correctly
-- Absorbing an 'out of range' runtime message (coc_filterComboBox)
   (conflict when loading from an old configuration file)
-- Found out why the libtiff package creates so much trouble during 
   installation. The shared libraries where contained in a hidden directory.
   Modified install.sh accordingly.



v2.1.2 (2010-05-16)

-- Reduced the statistics section for MEGAPRIME@CFHT, it was too large.
-- Explicitly exiting 'start' if processes are running already.
   Some code simplifications in this respect. Was done before too, but 
   in a less obvious manner.
-- Renamed V_ABSPHOT_MAXPHOTERROR to V_ABSPHOT_MAXPHOTERR in order to avoid
   an unintended rarely trigger of the error scanner when running with
   several CPUs (the string could be chopped up into smaller bits
   which could be cought by the scanner)
-- Removed a warning message that was printed into the log if
   non-existent files were about to be deleted 
   (process_bias_para.sh, process_flat_para.sh)
-- Fixed a bug in parallel_manager.sh that could call a script more
   often than needed, and without the string containing the chip IDs 
   as an argument for the additional scripts.
   In most cases this goes without problems, but it could critically fail
   in others.
-- Supporting data from Omega2000@CAHA



v2.1.1 (2010-05-15)

-- photometrix and make_checkplot scripts where not properly
   identified in the message window
-- catching astrometrix's "no match with reference catalog" error
-- removed the make_checkplot script called for astrometrix
-- Image extension was not correctly set anymore for some tasks
   when the 'transform images' script was set together with other
   scripts (introduced in 2.1.0 while simplyfying the code)
-- Enforcing 8bit output for flag images if transformed
   (modified fitsflip and transform_images.sh)
-- Prepended the full path to calls to "dfits" and "fitsort" in *.h
-- The coadd filter would not be loaded properly under certain 
   conditions after a restart.



v2.1.0 (2010-05-12)

-- Made the distort and binning spin boxes in the parameter dialogue
   clickable.
-- Offering again to kill theli if another job is found
-- Removed the ds9 button; it would not necessarily invoke ds9
   depending on some user settings outside theli
-- The defringing would not work without previous superflatting
-- Moved the location of the superflat_exclusion file from $MAIN to 
   $MAIN/$SCIENCE/
-- Removed the option of plotting a chip boundary in the binned mosaics.
   It is now always plotted.
-- Fixed several bugs in the create_scamp.sh script; e.g., it would load
   the wrong ahead file under certain conditions.
-- Added an explanatory dialogue to the MOSAIC_TYPE parameter.
-- DATE-OBS and BAYERPAT keys were corrupted in fits headers
-- Create flag images even if no cosmic detection was activated
-- Link global flag images if a linked file system is used
-- Updated the tool-tip and the online help for the abs-photom task
-- Adjusted the STOP message shown if no flag images are found.
-- Added to the error scan list:
   "Permission denied"
   "fatal: cannot open file" 
   " 0 astrometric references loaded from theli_mystd_scamp.cat"
-- Fixed a bug in create_stdphotom_prepare.sh; a configuration file
   was spelled incorrectly.
-- Fixed a warning in create_astromcats_para.sh
-- The imaflags[iso] parameter could be appended several times to 
   singleastrom.param.sex (without consequences)
-- Fixed a loose end in the median function in fitstools.h. Not sure
   median would have been calculated correctly if only one data point
   was available.
-- Added support for direct absolute photometric calibration against
   2MASS and SDSS
-- Restructured the parameters dialogue and assigned the right page 
   of the widget stack to the corresponding "defaults" button (got mixed
   up after introducing absolute photometric correction)
-- Added ldacputxy to progs.ini
-- Added fitspic.c to fitstools
-- Redirecting the process IDs of aborted processes to /dev/null
-- Significant code simplifications in processinggroup_ap.h
-- Fixed a small bug concerning offtarget data in processinggroup_ap.h
-- Reduced memory consumption of swarpfilter for multi-chip cameras
-- Stabilised the installation of the TIFF library; header files could
   end up in the wrong place and a link to a shared library could point
   to nowhere.
-- Fixed a bug in create_bias/dark.sh; it could happen that the keyword
   carrying the DARK exposure time was not identified/set correctly.
-- Included a script to update the header of coadd.fits
-- Fixed the seeing value entry provided by the statistics module;
   It was broken by introducing another set of catalogues for absolute
   photometry.
-- Replaced a few 'ls -1' calls with P_FIND in critical places
-- Updated to missfits-2.4.0
-- Updated to fftw-3.2.2 (for users who haven't installed the 
   precompiled version for their OS)
-- Fixed a bug in the install script, resulting in omitted optional
   packages if more than one argument was given to the install script
-- Significantly reworked install.sh; replaced relative paths with
   absolute paths for better clarity and stability
-- Removed qfits-6.2.0 from the distribution; the needed 
   functionality is now included in the theli pipeline core;
   updated fitstools Makefile accordingly
-- Major restructing of the installation. The gui package is kept in
   its own directory including version number, same for the pipeline core.
   Only a linked 'theli/gui/' directory is created. Eventually this should
   lead to easier updates.
-- Removed a dozen unnecessary sextractor parameters (create source cat),
   resulting in about 20% speed improvement
-- Replaced all seeing measurements by consistent calls to 'preansitropy'
   based on FWHM_IMAGE and FLUX_RADIUS
-- Reworked and simplified the statistics dialogue significantly.
   The measurement process is now QProcess(ed), i.e. it doesn't freeze
   the GUI while running
-- Removed the 'local reference catalog' option
-- Removed the (already hidden) 'interpolate badpix' option
-- Removed the option to stack with swarp1
-- Fixed a small bug: if data from an earlier version (without seeing and RZP
   filtering for the coaddition) was reprocessed (stacked), an invalid 
   string for these parameters could be written into the database.
-- If images taken with different filters are located in the same directory, 
   then the user can select which ones to stack without moving files around.
-- The coadd FILTER string is appended to the coadd identifier. The latter
   can therefore be left empty as default.
-- The colour coding of the absphotom checkbox background wasn't implemented
-- Added to 'Miscellaneous' a dialogue that allows the user to determine the
   ZP of an image trough a direct comparison with 2MASS or SDSS.
-- The change processing status actions were inversly linked with the
   command window. Don't know when this happened.
-- More automatic deleting of large temporary files



v2.0.8 (2010-04-27)

-- Fixed the NFRAMES setting (corrupted in 2.0.7)
-- Modified the getkey function (would not strip whitespace from keywords)
-- Stabilised the splitting script for WFC@INT



v2.0.7 (2010-04-26)

-- Renamed fits images from .fits2tiff to _tiff.fits in 
   the TIFF conversion
-- I removed the memory progress bar as it is totally 
   meaningless under Linux.
-- Swarpfilter: auto memory determination unreliable.
   Hardcoded to 50% of physical RAM.



v2.0.6 (2010-04-26)

-- Further speed optimisation for swarpfilter.c; memory consumption 
   significantly reduced; automatic determination of optimal
   memory usage;
-- Bug fix in the transformation script. It aborted if flag
   images weren't present
-- Fixed the tooltip of the 'standard' dir line edit
-- Forcing the geometry of the dummy flag image to be identical to the
   flat. Turned out that if data from different instruments were combined
   that this could cause problems.
-- Aborting the GUI install.sh script if the fitstools compilation fails
-- theli.cpp would not necessarily catch and effectively kill other
   instances of theli if this was requested upon startup. If theli is
   already running, the PID is printed and we exit.
-- Replaced the determination of memory usage by much more accurate
   calls to sysconf(). No more 'green' misleading indications of swapping
   when actually no swapping is taking place. The progress bar text becomes 
   red if 95% or more are used.
-- Updated tabfocus order of color and parameter dialogs
-- Updated the WFI@MPGESO splitting script
-- Included ALTAU16M@VYSOS06 and Apogee_Alta_U16M
-- Simplified resample_filtercosmics.sh (faster initialisation)
-- Force SuprimeCam 2001-2008 images to be renamed to FRAMEID. If the user
   renamed the files then it could be difficult to identify unique exposure 
   names. 
-- Images from cameras with Bayer matrix are kept in one directory;
   color channels are processed in one go; the coaddition must still be
   done separately for each colour channel
-- Fixed a small bug in the coadd preparation script introduced when 
   implementing seeing and RZP filtering. Could lead to warning or errors
   if not all images listed in cat/chips.cat5 were present in the SCIENCE dir.
-- Forcing a link libtiff.so to libtiff.so.x if libtiff.so does not exist
   after installing the TIFF library
-- Removed a hardcoded path to swarp.xsl



v2.0.5 (2010-04-21)

-- Added optional minimum cluster size to coadd outlier rejection;
   corresponding changes in swarpfilter.c
-- Added optional mask expanding for bad pixels to the coadd 
   outlier rejection; corresponding changes in swarpfilter.c
-- Fixed a bug in process_science_para.sh: the script tried to rescale
   a (potentially non-existing) dark frame if the user does not want
   a bias/dark correction
-- Fixed a bug in create_globalweights_para.sh: the globalflag image
   was not created if a constant weight was requested.
-- Error messages for the globalweight expanded.
-- If a floating point value of 0.0 or a integer value of 0 is entered 
   for the cosmics threshold, then it is replaced by a blank value
   equivalent to no cosmics detection.
-- Added STOP messages to the coaddition, if an image does not
   have a corresponding WEIGHT or astrometric header file.
-- Removed a "/bin/bash: bad interpreter: permission denied" error
   if theli was started from within a directory in which the user
   did not have write/execute permission



v2.0.4 (2010-04-19)

-- Write the sky background value of each individual image into
   a SKYVALUE keyword
-- Removed some warning messages from the transform_images script
-- Significantly improved outlier rejection during coaddition:
   2-3 times gain in speed, and works also for stacks of only 3 or 2
   images
-- Several small changes to functionality of the colour dialogue
-- Fixed a warning in create_stats_table.sh
-- Hiding the interpolate bad pixel checkbox in the coadd configuration.
   This feature doesn't seem to work, or I don't know how to get it working.
-- Fixed the header of coadd.fits if stacked with swarp1 and using
   a position angle.
-- Print a warning if the images in the colour calib dialog are identical
   and if a RGB image is going to be created
-- Switched to FLUX_RADIUS for seeing convolution measurement (more stable)



v2.0.3 (2010-04-12)

-- Found a bug that would return few or no reference stars for colour 
   calibration if the coadded image was rotated (picking CDELT1 only to 
   determine the field of view leads to wrong results).
-- Prepended "LUM: " in the fits2tiff conversion with STIFF if the RGB option 
   is not chosen, to make clear that a b&w image is being created.
-- Found the reason why fitsgauss did not result in a convolved image if
   the kernel was too small. Added an automatic adaptive procedure.
-- Multi-threading for all lengthy tasks in the color dialogue.
-- Catalogs are not recreated for the colour calibration if they
   were already present. Significant gain in speed.
-- Optimised download of photometric reference sources for the colour
   calibration. The downloaded area was way too oversized. Cut the download 
   time more than half.
-- Changed the stiff maxval default from 10 to 2.
-- Removed focus from a few PushButtons.



v2.0.2 (2010-04-10)

-- The flag images were not transformed if transformation was requested.
-- I made the create_astromcat script more flexible. It checks for each
   image if a weight/flag is present and adjusts the configuration 
   accordingly. If cosmics detection is switched off, then no flag
   images are created.
-- Replace the DATAMD5 keyword with EXPTIME for a master BIAS/DARK.
   If the key does not exist, an EXPTIME key is added to the header
-- Switched off the flipping (-t 2) in dcraw to avoid confusion with bayer 
   matrix chips
-- Updated WFI@AAT (previously WFI@SSO) and added a splitting script
-- Fixed a small bug in create_scamp.sh introduced recently when deleting
   backup files
-- Changed the default for hot pixel filtering to false in create_astromcats
-- Added 'segmentation fault' to the error scan list
-- Expanded the error messages in swarpfilter.c somewhat.
-- Fixed a bug in the coaddition outlier rejection that could occur when
   a rotation angle was given.
-- Deleting coadd.fits after the first coaddition step. It is not needed.
-- Forcing 6 decimal digits for imstats




v2.0.1 (2010-04-07)

-- Changed the colour calibration script such that it does not
   divide by zero if only one reference source is found. In this
   case the rms value returned is now set to 0.0



v2.0.0 (2010-04-01)

Versions 1.7.x are collected under 2.0.0

-- Updated to pipeline core theli-1.0.0
-- Included tiff2fits in the fitstools
-- Replaced pnmtofits with tiff2fits (pnmtofits would segfault with some glibc)
-- Completed splitting script update for RAW files
-- Fixed a bug in the coaddition, which prevented the coaddition to start
   if no sky subtracted images were present. It should start, but the gawk
   command returned a 0 instead of an empty string.
-- If a master bias/dark/flat is found in the splitting directories,
   then no warning is printed but a message box shown. The data in the
   corresponding directories is left untouched.
-- Changed the focus policy of the #CCD spinbox in the create instrument dialog.
   The number could not be entered by hand but had to be selected with the 
   handles.
-- Included VIRCAM@VISTA
-- Create instrument: removed the 'force north up east left' checkbox
-- Create instrument: CD matrix and reference pixel can optionally be
   copied from the raw data; this is also the default setting
-- The OBJECT keyword would not be correctly set in the splitting script
   in more recent versions. Fixed it, and those of 4 affected cameras
   (affected cameras: commercial only)
-- Removed the VIMOS_2004@VLT configuration/splitting.
   Turned out to be unnecessary with the new splitting script defintion
-- Updated splitting scripts (for which it was necessary) to the new definition
-- Changed the default string for MJD to MJD-OBS in the splitting script 
   dialogue
-- The transformation code will automatically be filled with 'nccd' zeroes
   when switching to the splitting script creation dialogue
-- Updated fitsdemosaicbayer.c
-- Fixed a bug in the colour image seeing measurement script that would
   create the 'seeing' directory in the scripts directory (where I can't
   assume write permission anymore in a multi-user environment)
-- Removed the 'target seeing' column in the colour calibration dialogue.
   It did not carry any relevant information.
-- Included the absolute photometry module
-- Include the 'create_stats_table.sh' script, executed automatically after
   running astrometry
-- Suppress the reduction command if a STOP message is printed in the
   BIAS, FLAT, globalweight creation
-- Changed to max number of items displayed in the astref cat ComboBox
   from 10 to 11 items such that all CDS servers are displayed without 
   scroll bars  
-- Some large temporary files are deleted after the scripts finished,
   to slow down the accumulation of waste data in the tmp directory
-- The correct_crval script is only invoked if coordinates are
   entered into the RA and DEC fields
-- Put the 'Get catalog' button for the astrometric reference catalog
   back, and connected it with a QProcess such that the GUI remains
   interactive.
-- Added a home disk space warning
-- Small format changes in the Initialise section
-- Updated wcstools from version 3.7.6 to 3.8.1
-- Updated dcraw from version 8.95 to 8.99
-- Updated stiff from version 1.12 to 2.1.2
-- Updated libtiff to version 3.9.2 (no BIGtiff support yet)
-- Full CD matrix support for all Suprime-Cam configs; included a fix for
   the wrong sign in CD1_1 in early 2001 data
-- Included global .ahead files for all SuprimeCam configurations
-- Retrieving the reference catalog would not work if a integer number
   is entered for RA and DEC. Forcing floating point in that case.
-- Included fitshisto.c in the fitstools
-- Included getkey.c in the fitstools. 
   'gethead' from the wcstools would segfault with ESO HIERARCH keywords.
-- Included a bash.include file with a function that extracts
   WCS information from a FITS header
-- Major restructuring, rewriting, homogeneisation and cleaning of all 
   splitting scripts; 
   Replaced many dfits+fitsort commands by 'getkey'
   as it allows to return key values containing blanks (replaced by 
   underscores). the previous combination truncated the key which led
   to problems with OBJECT and FILTER keywords;
   Generalised EQUINOX (was hardcoded to 2000.0);
   General support for CD matrices whereever possible 
   (exception: e.g. instruments at WHT and INT);
   If several filters are in the beam in one instrument, then they are
   combined, e.g. FILTER=F1+F2; implemented where known;
   Bug fixes in some scripts for instruments which I rarely/never used;
-- Increased the size of the instrument LineEdit to accomodate longer
   instrument names
-- Replaced DFITS calls in cni_form.ui.h with GETKEY
-- Splitting script: calls 'get_wcs' from bash.include in order to
   preserve the CD matrix
-- Inserted another script after create_astromcats_para.sh that is only
   invoked for multi-chip cameras and merges the individual catalogs
   for later scamp processing. Like that this step is only done once if
   scamp is run several times, and it disentangles the scamp script
   significantly.
-- Deactivated the 'use header' option with scamp. This never worked as 
   intended, and I haven't really understood how to make it working.
-- The create_scamp.sh script was largely rewritten. I introduced random
   exposure shuffling as that seems to lead to slightly improved results.
-- Forcing floating point presentation in create_stdcat_fromWEB.sh, as 
   'aclient' would not handle integer coordinates properly. I had one case 
   where the average RA value was so close to an integer that awk returned
   an integer, resulting in no return from aclient.
-- Small layout change in the movie dialogue
-- Added a "-maxdepth 1" option to all 'find' commands
-- Activated different coaddition sky systems and projections
-- Set the minimum number of connected pixels for cosmics from 3 to 1
   (default)
-- Added DT and DMIN parameters for better fine-tuning towards hot pixels
   and cosmics
-- Figured out why swarp2 would write inconsistent CDELT / CDmatrix
   (reason: pixscale_type manual must also be set in the two last coaddition 
   scripts). Swarp2 is now the default for resampling and coaddition.
   I offer swarp1 for backwards compatibility. There are tiny differences in
   the fluxes (on the order of 0.0001). Swarp1 is still used for the creation
   of the coaddition header. Coaddition is a lot faster now.
-- Repaint default paths in Initialise when switching from a different 
   section into Initialise. If a directory or path name has changed outside 
   theli, then this is now reflected in a change of background colour of the 
   corresponding field.  
-- Global weights recreate normalised flat field if it isn't found
-- Removed the explicit command line arguments from the create globalweight
   section; parameters are passed in the background; the command window
   does not get erased when the configure button is clicked.
-- Create flag images
-- Added alternative stiff support for FITS2TIFF conversion
-- Added various green notification messages to the message TextEdit.
   E.g., if no unprocessed images are found, but a superflat hasn't been 
   calculated but is requested, then instead of a STOP message I just call
   the superflatting script and print a note into the message window.
-- Included pyfits-2.2.2 again as it has been removed in theli-1.0.0
-- Removed the last two arguments from create_astromcats_para.sh.
   They were the same all the time or can be reconstructed from the
   other arguments
-- Included optional seeing and rzp filtering for the coaddition
-- Removed the explicit command line arguments from prepare_coadd_swarp.sh;
   Cleaned up the script
-- Removed the 4th argument from resample_coadd_swarp.sh, as it was
   not needed anymore.
-- Included crosstalk correction for HAWAII-2 detector arrays
-- The execution of a crosstalk correction was not reflected in the
   message window; fixed.
-- Introduced the options to filter outliers and draw chip borders 
   when creating binned mosaics. Modified album.c and make_album scripts
   accordingly.
-- Parallelised check_files.sh; in addition, only individual chips are
   moved to BADMODE, not entire exposures
-- Fixed a possible bug in check_files; it could be that the empty string ""
   was not properly understood by some bash interpreters
-- An additional object catalog filtering can be switched on 
   if the data are plagued with hot pixels (e.g. VIRCAM@VISTA)
-- Added the file extension keyword as a third argument, in case
   catalogs from different processing statuses are present.
-- Write the exposure time of the first bias/dark exposure into the
   header of the master bias/dark.
-- Automatic rescaling of the dark frame if the exposure times between the
   dark and the science deviate by equal or more than 1%. Images in the
   science directory must still have the same exposure time, though.
-- Full support for CCD and CMOS chips with bayer colour matrix;
   demosaicing is done after preprocessing.
-- Limited the max pixscale error to 2.0, the scamp internal upper limit
-- Removed the choice for the bayer demosaicing method. We are using the
   PPG method as it yields the best results.
-- Removed the 'is bayer' checkbox from the create new instrument dialog.
   Not necessesary anymore.



v1.7.6 (2010-02-09)

-- Included the STL-6303 camera
-- Modified the output format of 'getstats' from 'printf %f' to 'printf %g'
-- Added GPC1@PS1
-- If the superflatting window size is left empty, then it is reset
   to zero.
-- Updated the very old FORS2_1CCD splitting script (did not work)



v1.7.5 (2009-12-27)

-- The warning message complaining about a too small number of
   files (bias, dark, flat) did not work reliably. Fixed.
-- Replaced all numeric equality comparisons by string comparisons
   and homogenised the bash syntax in such comparisons.
-- Catching a "too long to connect" error returned by 'aclient'
-- Adjusted default settings in the parameters dialog
-- Added the option of forcing the sky background to a certain value
   in the object detection. Necessary for pan-starrs chip-stage images
   with lots of NAN-ed pixels which would totally distort the background
   estimate
-- Offering various servers for downloading reference catalogues
-- Replaced cdsclient findxxxx commands with 'vizquery'
-- Online magnitude filtering for TYC and GSC1.2 before download
   (not for the other catalogues as not all magnitudes are present
   every time)
-- Removed the 'get catalog' button; the number of objects retrieved is
   displayed directly in the message window. If zero objects are returned, 
   then a red warning is printed.
-- Mention in the tool tips of the instrument configuration that
   cut-on x/y must be larger than zero
-- The 'configure' buttons in the weighting section erase the command
   window only if necessary
-- Reduced the minimum area to which the GUI can be resized; 
   should fit rather low screen resolutions now
-- The GUI launches with the same geometric size it had when it was 
   closed last time 
-- Moved the 'view processing log' actions into the main 'view' menu.
   Removed the 'view private std catalog log' option (did not exist
   anymore)
-- A STOP message is printed if a master bias/dark/flat is present
   in a directory where raw data is being split.
-- Master calibration files are deleted if encountered in the
   bias/dark/flat/science directories before they are recreated.
-- Added fitsblend.c to the fitstools



v1.7.4 (2009-12-07)

-- Fixed the CFH12K99 configuration
-- Made the binned TIFF creation more stable
-- Colour dialogue: images that go into the fits2tiff conversion
   are not deleted anymore (suffix: .fits2tiff)
-- Included the fitsblend routine in fitstools



v1.7.3 (2009-11-03)

-- Included fitsgrad, fitsdemosaicbayer and fits3max in the fitstools
-- The bad pixel masking based on flatfields is now activated by 
   default
-- Expanded some tooltips
-- The distribute set task now creates SCIENCE_set_n directories instead
   of set_n directories to avoid accidental overwriting if called from
   different SCIENCE directories in the same mainpath. The SCIENCE field
   in the Initialise section will be set to SCIENCE_set_1 when this task
   is executed.
-- Removed RadioButtons from the tab stop sequences, made SpinBoxes 
   accept focus upon mouse-click
-- Updated the splitting script for PFC@WHT
-- Rearranged the order of the reference catalogs
-- Support for SDSS-DR7 and UCAC3
-- Changing the web reference catalog will update the command list
-- CCDs with Bayer matrix are processed including bias, dark and flat,
   and then interpolated and separated into SCIENCE_[R,G,B] directories
-- Made make_scampcat.py readable for other users than the owner.
   It would not execute on multi-user systems if no read permission
   was given.
-- Binned mosaic task now produces TIFFs as well, also for 
   single chip cameras (easier to eyeball)
-- Removed some warnings from the process_science script
-- Removed "step 1/2/3" from the coaddition message window
-- Font size of the FITS header preview linked to the GUI font size
-- If no cosmic detection should be made then the corresponding parameter 
   field should simply be left empty or set to zero
-- Split the creation of a superflat into a separate script, more transparent
-- No more superflatting normalisation is done as no use is made of that image
-- Updated the inline help and tool tip sections
-- Replaced calls to missfits for slicing fits cubes by fitscubeslice
-- FITS2TIFF conversion: tiff min from 2 times rms to 6 times rms
-- Added a disk space warning message!
-- Removed the 'use offtarget' checkbox from the global weights.
   Unnecessary with the new bad pixel recognition method.
-- Creating ds9 catalogs for overlay. Skycat- and ds9-catalogs are saved in
   cat/skycat and cat/ds9cat subdirectories
-- Merged single- and multi-chip scripts for scamp
-- A 'plots' directory is now always created in SCIENCE
-- Supporting XML output for scamp. To view the xml file with firefox, you must 
   enter about:config in the address field and change 
   security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to 'false'
-- A ds9 reference catalog is saved under cat/ds9cat/
-- Changed an ERROR message to STOP in order to prevent execution.



v1.7.2 (2009-09-30)

-- Support flipped matching for scamp
-- Changed the creation of the global weight images a bit, such that
   the detection of bad columns and rows is not affected by globally
   masked regions anymore (neglecting all pixels with values below
   FLAT_MIN)
-- The new instrument path variables were not yet read by the colour 
   image dialogue; fixed.
-- Checking for duplicate instrument names. If a duplicate instrument is 
   found, then a warning message is printed
-- Fixed the instrument path in the colour dialogue. Was broken after
   introducing different instrument directories
-- Some graphical reformatting and simplifications in the GUI
-- Replaced the one transformation ComboBox with two, one for flipping
   and one for rotation. Doesn't offer more functionality but probably
   makes life a bit easier.
-- Removed the 'File' menu from the menu bar. it didn't contain anything
   one couldn't do through the GUI anyway. And the GUI can simply be closed
   by closing the window.
-- Removed the "processing all" and "abort all" functionality from the
   pull down menu. It was not (and probably never) fully consistently 
   supported. I kept the corresponding code in the source though, should
   demand arise for such a functionality.
-- The Reduction pull down menu was renamed to 'Status', as nothing else
   is contained in it anymore.



v1.7.1 (2009-09-24)

-- Print a STOP message if scamp is going to be executed but not found in
   the bin/Linux directory
-- Removed the normalised superflat from the option for creating bad pixel
   masks while creating the global weight
-- Scamp will only run on the images present in the SCIENCE directory,
   but not on the catalogs present in the cat directory
-- Included ACAM@WHT and the new 2008 configuration for SuprimeCam
-- The first step of the coaddition takes its reference coordinates now
   from the first .head file, and not from the header of the first image
   in the list (which, depending on the users actions, can happen to not
   contain astrometric information)
-- Generalised the nonlinearity correction. The user can add his own 
   file with polynomial coefficients for any instrument
-- The scripts creating the BIAS/DARK/FLAT master images do not check
   for the existence of these files anymore. The master images will
   always be recreated. The previous behaviour led to confusion and thus
   I removed it again.
-- More multi-user environment adjustments in the installation script



v1.7.0 (2009-09-10)

-- Changes throughout the code to make THELI run in a
   multi-user environment. essentially, all configuration files,
   scripts, temporrary files etc created during runtime are now 
   created under ~/.theli/ and not anymore in the installation path
   which might not be writable for the user. This was done to
   make THELI scisoft-compatible.
-- Expanded the superflat warning messages
-- Removed the SCIENCE / OFFTARGET override line edits
-- changed the coaddition ID default from 'DEFA' to 'default'
-- Divided the instruments into "professional", "commercial" and "user-defined"
-- Replaced missfits by fitscubeslice when it comes to slicing fits cubes
-- Split script dialog loads the recently created instrument, otherwise
   the currently displayed instrument in the main window
-- Fixed a bug that would read the wrong smoothing scale for the
   fringing model, and would smooth the fringe model without request.
   This bug was introduced in 1.6.0.
-- Fixed another small bug that would write a parameter incorrectly
   into the logfile. Introduced in 1.6.0.
-- Fixed a series of bugs in scripts that would start mixing exposures
   of different chips if the camera had more than 10 CCDs. Thanks to Stefan
   and Michael for identifying this one. Apparently, nobody has used theli
   for cameras with more than 10 CCDs for at least a year, otherwise that 
   would have cropped up much sooner.



v1.6.3 and v1.6.4

-- two minor bug fixes



v1.6.2 (2009-08-21)

-- Fixed an inconsistency in the astrometric/scamp catalogues
   which was introduced in the last version
-- Changed the install script (FFTW, TIFF, SWARP and NUMARRAY
   are optional)
-- Cleaned up the distribution directory



v1.6.1 (2009-08-08)

-- Fixed a bug in the nonlinearity correction of WFC@INT.
   The programme would crash on some machines.
-- dcraw 8.95
-- Included the LBC blue and red arm cameras on the LBT
-- Fixed a bug in fitscut, which would offset the reference pixel 
   by 1 in both dimensions 
-- Increased and homogeneised the length of files and path names 
   to 4096 in fitstools
-- Removed a lot of compiler warnings from the fitstools package
-- Added fitsmaskexpand to fitstools
-- Cleaned up the scamp and astrometrix scripts a little
-- Updated getstats.c
-- Fixed a bug in the statistics module (cat suffix was wrong after
   the previous update)
-- fitsbin maintains the CD matrix and updates the CRPIXi
-- added tifflabel to the fitstools



v1.6.0 (2009-06-22)

-- Added SDSS support for the colour calibration
-- Recentred the kernel in fitsgauss by half a pixel
-- Included PIXSCALE_MAXERR in the scamp parameters
-- Added the possibility to convolve the RGB channels of a
   colour image to the same seeing
-- Supporting dynamic superflats with offtarget fields
-- Support for smoothing of the fringe correction image
-- Included sextractor 2.8.6 to overcome a strange bug 
   with the reported RA/DEC of rotated images
-- No error message is printed if the superflat is based on the
   OFFTARGET field and no superflat is present in the SCIENCE dir
-- Fixed a bug in create_scamp_mc.sh that could crash the photometry
   (division by zero)
-- Made the colour dialogue more robust (didn't behave when re-launched)
-- Restructured the B-V colour dialogue and its functionality
-- Removed a bug that would make the 'use offtarget' checkbox
   invisible if no offtarget data was present, but if the box was
   checked beforehand a STOP message would still be printed, hence
   catching the user in a situation which was difficult to break out of.
-- Data directories in external dialogs display the current paths even
   if they were changed just before the launch of the dialog (the DB
   was not updated soon enough)
-- changed the default behaviour of combine_images. If no name filter is
   given, all images are taken (i had to default 
   FILTER=* in combine_images_para.sh) for that
-- Included fitscopyhead in the fitstools
-- Included the 'average white' option in the colour dialogue
-- Made the colour calibration more robust; only objects with a max error
   of 15% are allowed in the process
-- Fixed a bug in the B-V calibration. The red weight was wrong and always
   very close to the green weight.
-- Updated the internal colordir science path variable when the path was
   changed (wasn't the case previously)
-- Contrast scaling for the RGB preview available
-- Smaller layout changes to the colour dialogue
-- Determine the seeing from the first sex catalog, don't run sex
   twice to get class_star right. not needed for astrometry.
   Should run twice as fast now, write SEEING_IMAGE and SEEING_WORLD
   into the FIELDS table. I keep only two catalogs: .cat and .skycat
-- Create source cat now runs also if no WEIGHT images are present;
   Renamed create_astromcats_weights_para.sh to create_astromcats_para.sh
-- Increased the sextractor MEMORY params to reduce stack overflows


v1.5.1 (2009-03-10)

-- Included the distortion SpinBox in the tab order, can have focus
-- Fixed a small bug in the sky position angle function of the coaddition
-- Included the EOS20
-- Possibly fixed the bug that unexpectantly changes the instrument
-- The clear button in the manual sky config only clears the statistics table
-- consistency check layer did not work with spread sequence task
-- Removed the libtiff and fftw libraries from the compilation.
   They should better be installed system wide.
-- Made xmemory.c and qfits_memory.c compatible with gccv4.3 
   (adding 0666 as a third argument to the open() call)
-- updated dcraw, gifsicle, missfits, swarp2 and stiff
-- missfits does not compile properly under gcc 4.3.3; included a
   fitscubeslicer as an alternative
-- removed some compiler warnings in the fitstools


v1.5.0 (2009-02-17)

-- This version is compatible only with theli-0.12.0.4
-- Added the possibility to switch off fringe scaling in preprocess.c;
   corresponding changes in the GUI
-- Added the option to make an additive scaling instead of a
   multiplicative scaling for the fringes in preprocess.c
-- Increased the COMBINE_MAXVAL parameter for preprocess to 1e8
   (it was set to 1e5 which is way too low for some data)
-- Fixed a few small bugs overlooked in the last release
-- Removed pyfits from the gui distribution. It is included
   in theli.tar.gz
-- Expanded the error messages a bit
-- Updated the create_stdcat_fromWEB.sh script as there was a small
   format change in the downloaded catalogs
-- Check that the main path is absolute
-- Extensive layer of new STOP messages if the user does not enter
   enough information
-- Changed the collapse correction, using the cleaner OBJECTS image and
   invert it rather than using the somewhat spurious -OBJECTS image
-- fixed a bug in the globalweight script (existing old temporary files
   could influence the result)
-- removed the override directories for BIAS and FLAT in the
   calibration section
-- Theli now remembers which reference catalog was chosen, and loads/shows
   the correct one after a tab change or reload
-- Theli now remembers the path to the reference image and the associated
   DT and DMIN
-- Print a big warning upon startup if /bin/sh -> /bin/dash
-- Removed some Default buttons which became useless
-- I removed the option of "no sky subtraction", as this was very
   confusing. If no sky subtraction was done, then the .sub images
   are missing, and the coaddition scripts will automatically take
   the unskysubtracted images.
-- The sky config dialog has been simplified
-- Fixed the numarray installation which would fail if on a 64-bit
   system a 32-bit version of 'scisoft' was installed
-- Build a switch into INITIALISE that allows the user to switch off/on
   the automatic processing of OFFTARGET data (default: off)
-- Made the superflatting section a bit clearer (association between scripts
   and 4 optional switches)
-- Fixed a bug that would print the 'scamp' command twice for the OFFTARGET 
   field
-- The image extensions are set to zero when the SCIENCE directory has the
   originals restored. The Change processing status menu is updated
   accordingly.
-- Removed the focus of a lot of GUI elements. The tab stops should work
   better now when cycling though the LineEdits
-- Added a series of "Redo" buttons for various tasks.
-- All pixels in the globalweight can optionally be set to 1
-- Fixed a long-standing bug in swarpfilter. Now it runs on mosaic 
   data as well, and it is significantly faster. I had to use the
   latest qfits library (6.2.0) for that, though.
-- Included a check that tests the network connection before downloading
   a catalog.
-- Change the internal sign of the sky position angle in the coadd  
   configuration. If an image is taken with PA=x degrees, then entering
   'x' for the sky position angle will make the image appear 'unrotated'
   in the coaddition.



v1.4.0 (2009-01-26)

-- Added the option in the astrometric configuration to add the
   zero-order solution found directly to the FITS header
-- Removed the 'rename' task from the preparation section. It is
   available through the parameter configuration (splitting script).
-- All splitting scripts were updated.
-- Updated the help texts available from within the GUI
-- Moved the parameters for the sorting script into the parameter
   configuration.
-- reference RA and DEC fields show "from header" when empty
-- Removed the "create source cat" task from the coaddition section.
   It was pretty much useless there.
-- Renamed the "clear" log file button into "reset"
-- Reorganised some smaller programmes in the installation process
-- An old 'plots' directory created by a single-chip scamp process
   is deleted once scamp runs again, to avoid left-over plots from the
   previous, potentially faulty, solution
-- Scamp now has the option to use the header files from a previous
   run as an initial starting point
-- Added support for arbitrary sky position angles in the coddition;
   The output image sizes are not yet determined in a smart way, images
   can have lots of empty space around them
-- In the skysub configuration, the "empty region" can now also be
   given in sky coordinates. For mosaic cameras, THELI will identify 
   the chip containing that region.
-- Added the possibility to switch the sextractor source filtering
   on/off in the creation of the superflat. In case of numerous hot
   pixels (near-IR cameras) the filtering would increase the masked
   area by a factor of 8, as the surrounding (good) 8 pixels were
   flagged as well.
-- Removed the Start/Abort sections from the menu
-- Shortened the GUI manual significanty
-- Added the WCS tools (needed some functions from it)
-- Improved the installation script a bit
-- The coaddition supports a proper motion vector
-- The 'size' parameter in the outlier filtering has disappeared.
   Turned out its value could be fixed.
-- Included LDSS3@LCO; splitting script needs to be verified
-- Added a softlink to libtiff.so.3 if libtiff.so.4 exists


v1.3.1 (2009-01-20)

-- Included advanced detection of bad pixel groups and rows/columns in the
   global weighting process.
-- launch job checks if theli is already running (by the same user), and 
   will close the running version if requested before launching a new 
   instance.
-- Added EXPTIME = 1.0 to the header of the coadded image
-- Included a SuprimeCam_200101 configuration
-- Optional masking of blooming spikes (so that rotated images can recover
   the information lost)
-- Added -p -32 to the P_IC call in the create_norm.sh script if
   externally processed flatfields in integer format are given
-- Small layout changes
-- Catching some error messages which would otherwise be sent to the console
-- Included a read-only backup copy of all *.ini files (in case they are set 
   to zero file length if no disk space is left)
-- 'fitswrap' corrects for the reference pixel
-- included the GSC1.2 catalog as a low-density supply for extreme
   wide field images
-- The Bayer matrix in DSLR RAW files is interpolated using DCRAW when
   splitting the images
-- Split the weighting section in the configure dialogue into two sections.
   Now there are two corresponding 'configure' buttons.
-- Moved the use_bias and use_offtarget checkboxes for the creation of the
   global weights from the main window into the configure dialogue.
-- Swapped the order of tasks in the weighting processing group
-- Fixed a small bug in the manual sky section which would prevent one
   of the combo boxes to come up highlighted in the same state as it was 
   left.
-- Small layout changes in the manual sky dialog
-- included the 'rename' command from the util-linux package because it was
   missing on Debian-based linuxes


v1.3.0 (2008-10-26)

-- to run this version properly, theli-0.12.0.3 is needed!
-- the colour image dialogue has seen very significant extensions;
   most of the process is now automatised or accessible through the GUI,
   including selection of coadded images and the creation of chi-square
   images
-- included movie creation of resampled images
-- printing statistics in the colour dialog with full precision, to avoid
   truncation of numbers in exponential format
-- reformatting the 'timestamp' in RAW format images into DATE-OBS format
-- Fixed a huge bug in the sky subtraction (the mode was estimated wrongly
   if a very significant fraction of pixels had been masked)
-- Included a SBIG ST2000XM camera in the instrument list
-- stabilised the seeing measurement
-- stabilised the output of the seeing value in the statistics dialog
-- modified the mjd programme so that it accepts the DATE-OBS format
   from FITS headers
-- Fixed a bug in the B-V dialogue which occured for 3 or less reference 
   stars
-- Ds9 masks are now taken into account in the weighting process even if
   cosmics detection (individual weighting) is switched off
-- Created scamp .ahead files for MOSCA, VIMOS, WFC, HAWK-I and PFC@WHT
-- Fixed a small bug in the combine_images script that would not move
   temporary files to their correct destination


v1.2.4 (2008-08-15)

-- Added two critical scamp errors to the list of critical errors that are
   caught by THELI. These errors are characterised as WARNING only in the 
   scamp output
-- Streamlined the scamp calling syntax
-- Full support for MEF images for scamp; activated pyfits and numarray 
   compilation
-- Updated to cdsclient-v3.01; much cleaner catalog handling is possible 
-- When downloading a web catalogue or a local copy, the ddd.ddd->hhmmss.ss 
   conversion is no longer performed with imcat which was painfully slow 
   for large catalogues. I wrote decsexconv.c for this purpose, and also
   use the 'astrometrix format' option in get_pmm_objects
-- made theli ignore some "false" error messages in the log files, e.g.
   strings containing an "error" substring (for example, the name of some 
   scamp checkplots triggered theli to report an error)
-- using scamp one can now choose to use existing focal plane information,
   or to create a new FP based on the current data set
-- Added the SDSS-R6 as a possible astrometric reference source, even though 
   it is not an all-sky catalogue.
-- Implemented a standard B-V calibration for true colour images
-- Replaced FLUX_RADIUS by FWHM_IMAGE in the catalog creation filtering
-- filtering out another error message that would accidentally be cought by 
   THELI
-- fixed a bug in the web-catalog script
-- modified the output of imstats so it would always give full floating
   point precision
-- expanded the colour image dialogue to accomodate the B-V calibration
-- updated the astrometric reference catalog from GSC 2.2 to GSC 2.3
-- when RA and DEC are entered in astrom/photom, the user can now choose
   if these coordinates are transferred into the fits header or not.


v1.2.3 (2008-05-29)

-- Introduced an optional, automatic revision of the DT parameter
   for the collapse correction.
-- Dropped the maximum length of the coaddition identifier.
   The default is still set to "DEFA"
-- Fixed a bug in the script that sorts the raw data into
   biases, flats etc.
-- The script that renames the raw data files into a name given by
   a FITS keyword now assumes that the raw data is in the main
   directory. The corresponding LineEdit in the GUI has been removed.
-- The scripts that calculate the master BIAS/DARK/FLAT now exit
   without further processing if a master BIAS/DARK/FLAT is being found.
-- Included the optical and near-IR imagers of GROND@MPGESO
-- Included a Canon EOS 350 DSLR color CMOS chip
-- Changed some of the parameter default values
-- Removed the "number of exposure" fields in the Initialise PG.
   This was more confusing than helpful and did not always work
   as intended.
-- Removed the gain LineEdit from the instrumentation config dialog. 
   It was unused and is very unlikely to be used in the future. The
   field remains in the config files for consistency, though, 
   defaulted to 1.0.
-- Removed the CDELT1/2 LineEdits from the instrumentation config dialog. 
   They were redundant and are now directly calculated PIXSCALE.
-- Many updates and a lot of code cleaning in the fitstools package
   which now also has its own Makefile. The installation script has
   been updated.
-- Set the max pointers in xmemory to a value larger than 32000
   to avoid problems with the fitscollapse task on large images
-- Removed any hidden elements for standard star processing from 
   the GUI. There was never the need for using them.
-- Fixed a bug that would not show the cross-talk icons when theli
   has not been launched from the installation directory.
-- Included the QHY8 CCD camera (chip has bayer matrix)
-- Changed the LIRIS splitting scripts such that it also works on the
   diff_pre store mode which has two FITS extensions. The second extension
   containing the pre-read is discared.
-- Fixed a bug that would not restore the ORIGINAL images if the restoration
   has taken place before on the same directory
-- Set the default RA value in the splitting script to 180 degrees instead
   of zero if no RA key is present in the data. swarp v1.38 seems to not like
   images that have exactly RA=0
-- Changed from the SEGMENTATION image back to the -OBJECTS image in
   combine_images_para.sh; the first version did not run stable on all
   kinds of data
-- Fixed a bug in the gaussian sky subtraction. it could happen that the
   remaining sky was flattened, but not zero on average.
-- Made some instrument config files more homogeneous
-- Dropped the "_eclipse" in the file names of the scripts
-- Updated the fitstools Makefile which was leading to problems with the
   TIFF library on some systems
-- Supporting the 'RAW' format of DSLR cameras (transformed into FITS) 
-- Supporting Bayer matrix FITS data (gets splitted into individual FITS) 
-- Fixed the tab order as far as Qt would allow (seems to be buggy, the
   result is not what it should be)
-- Colour dialogue: images removed from the list now get physically
   moved to a "unused" subdirectory to avoid interferences.
-- Removed some compiler warnings.
-- Restructured and simplified the instrument configuration and splitting
   script dialogs.
-- Implemented a new algorithm for the swarp filter that allows for a 
   more intelligent recognition and rejection of bad pixels (has been 
   trained on numeric simulations). The reason is that in a small
   series of images statistical outliers are difficult to recognise due
   to the small sampling size.
-- supporting swarps INTERPOLATE keyword
-- Forced the PIXSCX keyword to be negative in all instrument configs
-- Merged ALFOSC_old (old fits header) with the normal ALFOSC splitting 
   script
-- Fixed a bug in the Sextractor catalog script in the coaddition section
-- The reference pixel is now updated when running fitsflip and fitscut
-- Added a programme to fitstools that adds a key to a FITS image


v1.2.2 (2007-12-18)
Many bug fixes, most of them were introduced in v1.2.0 when 
I switched to the new parameter handling scheme; 
Quite some functional changes, too

-- The user does not have to provide a file suffix anymore.
   This just proved to be awkward and was unnecessary anyway.
   The suffix is now determined automatically.
-- When starting a new reduction with an empty logfile, the
   crosstalk correction buttons showed the "active" thumbnails
   instead of the "passive" thumbnails. Fixed.
-- When the user entered a new log filename that did not exist 
   yet, and then clicked on "clear log", the currently selected
   instrument got deselected, and instead the first instrument 
   in the list was chosen. This is probably an obsolete safety 
   feature I implemented a long time ago when the gui was still 
   in its infancy. I do not see any reason for this anymore and 
   hence deactivated this switch (besides this behaviour was 
   annoying).
-- While debiasing and flatfielding the data, it could happen that
   the "data has been superflatted"-switch was incorrectly set,
   which would made THELI assume the file extension is OFCS instead 
   of just OFC.
-- The script that sorts a bunch of raw data into BIAS/FLAT/SCIENCE 
   etc sub-directories was apparently lost from the latest releases.
   Apparently noone is using it, otherwise I'd have received complaints.
   Anyway, it is back now with simplified syntax.
-- I updated the LIRIS, SOFI and ISAAC splitting scripts so that
   they check for the number of readout averages (COAVE or NDIT),
   set the EXPTIME keyword to EXPTIME*NDIT, and multiply the
   image correspondingly with NDIT. The original EXPTIME keyword is
   stored in EXPT_DIT for reference. Otherwise one will get into deep 
   trouble with relative photometric zeropoints and/or weight scaling 
   factors during the coaddition when mixing exposures taken with
   different NDIT settings.
-- There was a hickup when selecting "no sky subtraction", fixed.
-- Fixed a bug in the astrometrix script that was introduced in the
   previous version (forgot to comment a line out after testing)
-- If a list of chips of a mosaic camera was given for coaddition, 
   it would not be interpreted correctly.
-- Fixed a bug in imstats.c that would not read the upper range
   given with the -t option properly if in exponential format.
-- Changed the "magic" values of +/-70000 to something like +/-1e9
   to avoid conflicts with near-IR data and certain CCDs that can 
   get such high ADUs.
-- Fixed a bug in the calculation of the RZP with scamp if images
   with different exposure times were used (thx thomas)
-- The global weights task would not appear in some cases if the
   configure button was not clicked beforehand.
-- updated the script that filters outliers during the coaddition 
   process.
-- fixed the cross-talk correction
-- I included the option of convolving the sky background with a Gaussian
   for modelling. This seems to work a lot better than the SExtractor 
   modelling in "difficult" cases (those with large residuals).
-- Speeded up the swarpfilter programme by a factor of 2. It now works
   on mosaic data as well.
-- Included an optional integer pixel shift method in the astrometry 
   section
-- Updated the ESO near-IR splitting scripts. Old ISAAC and SOFI headers 
   were misleading (EXPTIME=NDIT*DIT instead of EXPTIME=DIT)
-- Replaced all calls to awk by ${G_AWK}
-- Changed all astrometry scripts such that they would only take into account
   images in the SCIENCE dir, and not just all catalogs in cat (hence unwanted
   images can temporarily be moved away without repeating the same for the
   catalogs) 
-- Fixed a small bug in the 'statistics' section that occured for
   cameras having more than 9 detectors
-- Introduced a switch that allows to either include or exclude the centre
   image in the dynamic window for near-IR skybackground modelling.
-- Included HAWK-I@VLT, WIRCam@CFHT, SuprimeCam@SUBARU and MOIRCS@SUBARU
-- THELI now uses MissFits for the slicing of FITS cubes 


v1.2.1  (2007-08-05)
This is mainly a bug fix release

-- Removed the hardcoding of FGROUP_RADIUS=1.0 which was still present.
   This Scamp parameter can now be modified.
-- Fixed a small bug in fits_blockedit.c that placed the edited block
   one pixel too high.
-- fitsmask.c can now not only set pixels within a specified threshold 
   range to zero, but all other pixels to 1 if the -n option is used.
   However, this is not yet needed by any standard GUI operation.
   Will be useful for mask creation though at some day.
-- Removed the additive constant of 1000 that was added during the
   subtraction of the superflat, during chop-nod and collapse correction.
   Originally, this was introduced since the weighting process set the
   weight of all image pixels to zero if they had values of zero or less.
   However, that was witched off a long time ago and hence there is no need
   to maintain this additive constant.
-- I found that SEGMENTATION is a more stable sextractor checkimage than
   -OBJECTS. With the latter option sometimes objects are masked out which 
   should not be detected with the given thresholds. SEGMENTATION does
   not suffer from this. Need to check back with emmanuel.


v1.2.0  (2007-07-08)

-- Many changes on the code that do not affect the handling or
   appearance of THELI, e.g.
     - removed lots of compiler warnings under gcc4
     - makefile updated with LFLAGS linker options
-- Fixed a bug that would not allow to enter any numbers in the
   pixel scale and threshold fields of the coadd config dialog
-- Fixed a bug when loading a log file (dunno where this came from)
-- Updated scripts that divide images by a flatfield with a setting
   so that flats with modes of less than 50 ADUs do not lead to a
   halt.
-- Updated to scamp v1.3.11. Scamp stores its checkplots in the 
   SCIENCE/cat dir
-- introduced a colour scheme for better visualisation of the
   different gui elements
-- Included NICS@TNG and ENZIAN_CAS@HOLI_1m as instruments
-- Collected many parameter settings in a dedicated dialog.
   The parameter tables are replaced by it. The parameter dialog
   can now be called from various "Configure" PushButtons, that will
   bring up the corresponding "page". The user can also switch to
   the parameters of any other processing group once the dialog is 
   opened.
-- A first implementation of cross-talk correction is available.
   It is accessible through the "configure" PushButton in the
   preparation processing group, and still on an experiemntal basis.
-- Moved the sky subtraction task into the "coaddition" processing
   group to unclutter the astrom/photom group a bit more.
-- The sky subtraction now has its own configure dialog that combines
   all possible options.
-- Additional scamp-compatible catalogs are created for mosaic imagers 
   so that scamp can be exploited fully. However, this is still on a test 
   basis and requires the installation of two python modules.


v1.1.2  (2006-11-21)

-- included the much improved WIFIX_1.2_theli version of WIFIX.
   It basically fixes most of the installation problems.
-- updated the pipeline core to version 0.12.0, which amongst others
   fixes problems with sextractor compiled with gcc 4.1
-- included NACO@VLT as an instrument
-- simplified the installation a bit, fixed a small bug in the
   GUI install script (some systems do not accept relative paths 
   in the "prefix" option of configure scripts
-- modified the collapse correction so that the sky background can 
   be determined from one or two smaller image sections, to avoid
   biasing by extended low surface brightness haloes. The GUI has 
   been expanded by a corresponding configuration dialogue.
-- The coaddition has its own config dialogue. One can specify
   now a subset of chips from a mosaic that shall be coadded.
   In addition, the combination type has been expanded.


v1.1.1  (2006-07-13)

-- replaced the ascii log file system by internal QSettings variables.
   this fixed the extremely long startup times on fedora core 5 systems
-- made scamp and astrometrix more configurable through a separate
   dialogue
-- code streamlining, small improvements concerning the functionality
   of some GUI elements
-- no "/" can be entered any more in the data subdirectories in the
   "initialise" processing group. this could lead to errors since the
   file names of e.g. the master flat then had a "/" inside and where
   subsequently interpreted as directories.
-- the line edit of the "distribute sets" task will reset the number to
   the maximum allowed value of 1024 if a higher value has been entered
-- the dialog for creating the splitting script has been merged with
   the dialog for creating a new instrument.
-- removed the "delete log file" push button in the initialise processing 
   group
-- replaced the mean/median RadioButtons for image combination with a
   ComboBox
-- updated the online help, introduced tool tips for each processing task
-- improved FORS2, VIMOS, CFHT, MOSAIC1 scripts and configuration files
-- included IMACS, NOTcam and Dolores
-- updated cdsclient to version 2.85. Avoids problems with gcc4 compilers
   and 64bit systems


v1.1.0  (2006-05-31)

-- fixed a small bug in logfile.h. Did not affect anything.
-- Fixed a bug that would display the remaining disk space
   wrongly if the file system string reported by the "df -m"
   command is too long, leading to a line feed.
-- included "xpdf" as a pdf file viewer
-- included SOFI@NTT and ALFOSC@NOT
-- fixed a small bug that would print a wrong default path in the
   "manual sky" dialog if the main path entered in the Initialise
   PG did not exist
-- updated the cdsclient script and the GUI feedback (no ldac 
   catalog format created any more)
-- included support for SCAMP
-- modified the debias+flatfield script such that it now
   allows superflatting/defringing/subtraction based on a 
   "moving window" of images, i.e. a 'dynamic' superflat
-- merged the "process dark" with the "process bias" checkbox;
   no real need for having them both
-- fixed a bug in process_science_para.sh (the back size
   parameter was invoked wrongly due to a double-$$ instead
   of a single $ sign). Did not affect the object detection in a 
   bad way.
-- The path to theli/bin/Linux_64/ was not guessed correctly by the
   GUI on 64 bit systems. Affected the dialogs for statistics and
   manual sky determination.
-- Removed the Photometry CheckBox. There is no need anymore to 
   have it extra. It gets now automatically called after the 
   astrometry.
-- updated the TIFF library to version 3.8.2
-- the manual astroref catalog now takes into account the override 
   directory for SCIENCE
-- replaced 'fitspaste' by 'fitscut' to avoid licensing issues
-- included a nonlinearity correction in the splitting script of WFC@INT


v1.0.6  (2006-04-12)

-- Included a statistics GUI under "miscellaneous"
-- The "local copy" RadioButton in the astrometric reference catalog
   menu is now hidden if no such catalog is specified in the
   "Initialise" PG. Same holds for the "use OFFTARGET" CheckBox
   in the "Superflatting" PG.
-- There is now the possibility to subtract a constant sky from the
   images, either determined from one representative chip for the
   entire exposure, or from each chip. If desired, an image section
   can be chosen. Additionally, it is possible that no sky is subtracted.
   The sky can also be determined manually.
-- Fixed a bug in the creation of the splitting script that occurred if 
   additional keys are copied into the THELI header.
-- Added a "do not apply flat" CheckBox (e.g. for VISIR@VLT)
-- Small layout changes, cleaning up of the code
-- Included a pairwise chop-nod sky subtraction in the superflatting PG
-- Included a procedure that determines just the shift between images
   without caring for sky position angle and reference catalogues. The 
   solution is transformed into the usual format understood by swarp.
   This includes relative photometric zeropoints. With this step THELI
   is now capable of performing a full reduction of e.g. mid-IR data
   that feature as little as one detectable object per exposure.
-- Added support for masks created with latest versions of DS9
-- Added support for imaging masks, i.e. an image having pixel values 1
   for good pixels and 0 for bad pixels will be multiplied to the
   global weight if such an image is found in the scripts directory.
   It must have the same name as the instrument, plus a ".fits" suffix.
   Effect is the same as the global .reg file, but the image might
   be easier to create in some cases (such as VISIR)
-- No more dummy SUPERFLAT is created if the user does not calculate
   a SUPERFLAT. Consequently, the normalisation script gets only
   invoked if a SUPERFLAT has actually been requested.


v1.0.5  (2006-03-01)

-- Relaxed some of the regular expressions watching the line edits.
   That makes deleting easier.
-- Hiding the projection type and celestial type again, since
   they make swarp_v1.38 crash if different from TAN and EQUATORIAL.
-- Made the instrument configuration files accessible through
   the "Edit" pull-down menu   
-- Included the path to the THELI binaries in the code. Previously
   I assumed that the executables were in the search PATH. Problem
   was a call to 'hmstodecimal' in the coaddition PG.
-- Included another item under the "settings" menu for the selection
   of the favourite pdf viewer (currently acroread and gvv)
-- Introduced the "Miscellaneous" pull-down menu. It contains
   the color image dialog (previously under "reduction"), and a new
   dialog for combining a set of images.
-- Smaller technical improvements to the install.sh script and the 
   GUI. The installer is now compatible with ldacpipeline-0-10-1.
-- The user can now choose between a mean and median combination
   for the SUPERFLAT.
-- The three radio buttons and the combo box for the "transform"
   script were merged into a single combo box. The "kangle" parameter
   for astrometrix went into the parameter table where all the other
   parameters where waiting for it already. 


v1.0.4  (2006-02-15)

-- The "sextractor-eye" combination does not recognize cosmics in 
   undersampled data due to their great resemblance with the PSF. 
   An outlier rejection process is now available from within the 
   Coaddition processing group. Pixels with values higher or lower than
   a certain rms threshold have their weights then set to zero.
   If three or less pixels with non-zero weight are in the stack, 
   then no rejection is performed. The algorithm is currently slow
   for a larger number (>15 or so) of exposures or mosaics.
-- Made the validator watching the user input of the transformation code
   for the splitting script less stringent. One could not delete a number
   from within the string entered.
-- Some of the c-programs in the tools directory where adding a
   comment line to the FITS header. This caused segmentation faults
   appearing in an irregular fashion on some Linux systems, without
   clear preference. For compatibility, I switched the offending code
   off.
-- Fixed a bug in the distribute_sets.sh script. The ${TEMPDIR}
   was missing in some path.
-- Introduced lower and upper thresholds in the weighting process,
   and a corresponding parameter table.
-- Fixed a bug where the command lines of the create weights script
   and distribute sets script still showed up if no parameters were
   given. The default values were used then.
-- Removed the STATUS_WEIGHTS(OFF) variables and all dependencies.
   They were superflicious since they always have the same value
   as the status of the science exposures. 
   Same for the STATUS_OFFTARGET. I assume that if an OFFTARGET field
   is present, it will always undergo the same processing steps as the
   SCIENCE field. If THELI is used consequently, this is automatically
   the case anyway. So, no need to bother with it.
-- Included automatic OFFTARGET processing for the 'distribute set' step.
-- Small fixes of the layout and the integrated online help
-- The OFFTARGET processing is now fully supported in the astrom/photom
   group as well (the reference catalogue was not retrieved automatically
   for the OFFTARGET field before)
-- The create_astromcats script now produces skycat catalogues for overlay
-- Modified the global_weights script such that the DARK and SUPERFLAT
   constraints are no longer mandatory but optional. The corresponding
   parameters went into the parameters table.
-- The DEBLEND_MINCONT sextractor parameter is now accessible through the
   GUI. Exposures with very large objects might want its value to be changed
   to optimise the number and distribution of detected sources.


v1.0.3  (2005-10-30)

-- the status (checked/unchecked) of the photometrix script
   was not properly written to the logfile. this did not affect
   the data reduction but was just an annoyance.
-- made a work-around a Qt bug that set the dark-red foreground
   colour of mandatory CheckBoxes randomly to black when changes
   were made to the gui status
-- the color of the "process bias" checkbox now changes to black
   if the user checks the "do not apply bias/dark" checkbox.
-- included min and max thresholds in the calibration processing group
   for the biases, darks and science exposures. these thresholds
   were present already for the flat fields, and it is mandatory
   to explicitly specify them. outlying images are moved to a
   BADMODE directory. The manual reflects these changes.
-- hiding the memory progress bar if "uname" does not yield "Linux"
   as an operating system
-- BIAS / DARK / FLAT exposures are now combined directly in memory
   if the number of images is smaller or equal than the NFRAMES 
   parameter. If there are more images, temporary data is written 
   to disk in the previous fashion. Parameter handling is identical.
-- fixed a broken link in the help menu
-- up to now, if the "spread sequence" task in the calibration PG
   was used, the user had to process the corresponding subdirectories
   (SCIENCE_Si, and if applicable OFFTARGET_Si) individually. In this 
   release this has been automatised and all directories will be done
   automatically, unless a particular directory is entered in the
   SCIENCE/OFFTARGET field.
   This affects the "Debias / flatfield" task in the calibration PG,
   and the "Subtract Superflat" task in the superflatting PG.


v1.0.2  (2005-10-20)

-- fixed a bug in the create_weights scripts. A blank in the
   argument list could lead to the non-creation of the weight 
   images.
-- fixed a bug (missing newline character) in the routine that
   creates the data splitting script when a new instrument is
   included.
-- fixed a bug leading to double file name extensions such as
   OFCSDD instead of OFCSD if a task was repeated. This bug was
   introduced during the recent "Qt-ification" of the c-code.
-- fixed a bug in the script that creates an astrometric
   reference catalogue from an image. it caused three lines
   in the beginning with zeroes for the coordinates, which, in
   case of a very sparse and small field, confused astrometrix.
-- if the user selected some font size or style, it was saved in the
   log file but got overriden by some default styles upon relaunch
   of the GUI. this has been fixed.
-- Replaced some calls to strndup() with Qt native QString 
   functions. The motivation was non-compilation on MacOS X.
-- the command list gets now automatically updated if the
   processing status is changed through 
   Reduction->Change processing status
-- the LineEdit in the Initialise PG that took the pipeline
   path has been removed. The information is now hardcoded
   and gets initialised through the install script. The manual
   has been updated accordingly.


v1.0.1  (2005-10-03)

-- fixed a bug that could crash the GUI when the 
   pipeline path in the INITIALISE PG is partially deleted
-- fixed a bug in the parameter handling
-- fixed a bug in the install script (omitted ${BIN} in some paths)
-- improved parameter handling
-- improved the logfile handling
-- improved command syntax prediction. The file name extensions
   (OFC etc) came out wrong if the processing status was changed
   several times in a row.
-- updates to the GUI documentation (affected: all sections)


2005-09-16 v1.0.0 released
