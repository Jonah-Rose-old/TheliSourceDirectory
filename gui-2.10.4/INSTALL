             QUICK THELI INSTALLATION GUIDE
------------------------------------------------------------

Complete installation instructions, including software pre-requisites,
can be found on the THELI homepage:

http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~theli/gui

============================================================

Installation is straight forward and simple, assuming that 
all pre-requisites are met. The distribution comes with 

theli-<version>.tgz            (the pipeline core)
gui-<version>.tgz              (the graphical user interface)

Move them into one and the same directory, e.g.

/home/<user>/THELI/

Install the pipeline core:

tar xvfz theli-<version>.tgz
cd theli-<version>/pipesetup
./install.sh -m "ALL"

Install the GUI:

tar xvfz gui-<version>.tgz
cd gui-<version>
./install.sh

This will create soft-links to the installation directories:

THELI/gui   -> THELI/gui-<version>
THELI/theli -> THELI/theli-<version>

In this way you can maintain an older installation without problems.

Include the THELI/gui directory in your PATH variable, so that you can 
launch 'theli' from anywhere.
