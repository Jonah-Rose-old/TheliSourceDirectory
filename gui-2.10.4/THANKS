I'd like to thank the following people:

Albert Bosma, Andrew Cardwell, Carsten Moos and Richard Mueller
who gave a lot of feedback which made this UI a lot more versatile
and user friendly,

Carsten Moos for laying out the framework of the process
monitor and coding the PPG debayering algorithm,

Hans Lambermont for cleaning up some of my very non-c++ style
coding.

And last but not least all people who used THELI with new instruments
and came up with lots of useful suggestions and discoveries of bugs.
