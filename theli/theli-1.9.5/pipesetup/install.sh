# Main installation script for the THELI pipeline

# IMPORTANT:
#
# The script checks machine type, updates pipeline scripts (progs.ini;
# pipe_env ...)  and compiles pipeline sources the script needs the
# source file 'endian.c' in the directory it is called. Modify the
# paths listed below before running this script.

#
# Modes of the script
# 
# ./install.sh -m "TEST"
# tests the machine type and gives information whether you can compile
# sources without problems or whether you have to create new Makefiles
# (see the documentation for more details)
#
# ./install.sh -m "ALL"
# updates paths in all pipeline scripts and compiles pipeline sources
#
# ./install.sh -m "UPDATE"
# only updates paths in pipeline scripts
#
# ./install.sh -m "COMPILE"
# only compiles pipeline sources

#
# HISTORY COMMENTS:
# 
# 09.03.2006:
# - I removed the utilities scripts subdirectory from
#   the script updates. It contains no files needed in
#   the official THELI version.
# - I included MAC/Darwin systems to the known architectures.
#
# 14.03.2006:
# I changed the installation scheme for ASTROMETRIX: instead of
# overriding the original script files with modified ones, I keep the
# modified, renamed, ones in the pipeline structure and add the
# corresponding directory the PERL5LIB variable.  This allows us to
# directly call the modified ASTROMETRIX files with the perl
# interpreter.
#
# 27.04.2006:
# I adapted the location of 'global_vers.h' (it is now in
# ../ldactools/library and no longer in ../library)
#
# 01.05.2006:
# The pipeline version for the external version is 'THELI Pipeline
# Version: XXXX'. This allows a distinction to the internal sources.
#
# 15.05.2006:
# - I included a simple check for the presence of necessary, external 
#   programs defined in this script.
# - The script now prints some description when being invoked.
#
# 17.05.2006:
# - I changed slightly the welcome message
# - increase of the minor pipeline version number. 
# - I improved messages during the installation process.
# - The handling of the test for the availabbility of external
#   UNIX programs is more stable to account for architecture dependent 
#   behaviours of the 'which' program.
#
# 14.06.2006:
# - The availability of the external 'sm' program is checked via
#   a 'which' command now. 
# - Increase of minor pipeline version number.
#
# 30.08.2006:
# Increase of minor pipeline version number.
#
# 05.11.2006:
# - If the program 'sm' is not present, the variable P_SM
#   is set to an empty string. Without this the value could
#   be quite undefined. This avoids potential problems
#   in the 'sed' command which modifies the progs.ini file.
# - In the 'sed' command which modifies the progs.ini file 
#   I removed lines refering to IRAF.
#
# 06.11.2006:
# The version number goes to 0.12.0
#
# 18.09.2007:
# I included code for the possibility to use scamp within THELI. The
# script documentation was updated accordingly.
#
# 03.12.2007:
# I introduced Darwin_PPC and Darwin_INTEL systems; the old 'Darwin'
# was removed. This was necessary as the Intel and PPC MACS come with
# different byte swap for floating point numbers.
#
# 06.07.2008:
# Cosmetic changes to avoid error messages during install
#
# 21.12.2008:
# - The interpreters for python and perl are defined now
#   also via variables. The main problem was that 'alias'
#   deinitions were not taken into account in pipeline
#   script calls leading to problems when the script 
#   interpreters were privately installed.
# - I updated the documentation
#
# 09.02.2010:
# Improvements to the verification of installation requirements.
#
# 15.03.2010:
# Bug Fix: Configuration files for WFI were not copied correctly
# to the 'MACHINE' directory
#
# 30.03.2010:
# I included the perl script 'stellar_locus.pl' which needed
# modification in the updatescripts part.
#
# 31.08.2010:
# Version number goes to 1.2.1
#
# 16.09.2010:
# Version number goes to 1.2.2 (internal production version)
#
# 16.09.2010:
# Version number goes to 1.3.0 (new official release)
#
# 08.10.2010:
# Version number goes to 1.3.1 (internal production version)
#
# 26.11.2010:
# - MEGAPRIME files are now included in the distribution
# - Version number goes to 1.4.0 (internal production version);
#   new swarp version and associated changes
#
# 17.01.2011:
# version number goes to 1.4.1 (internal production version)
#
# 24.05.2011:
# version number goes to 1.5.0 (release version; several important bug fixes)
#
# 13.06.2011:

# architectures.
#

# Version number goes to 1.5.2 (minor bug fixes)
#
# 05.09.2011:
# Version number goes to 1.5.3 (minor bug fixes / enhancements)
#
# 26.01.2012:
# Version number goes to 1.6.0 (bug fixes / enhancements)
#
# 31.01.2012:
# Version number goes to 1.6.1 (bug fixes / enhancements)
#
# 19.11.2012:
# Version number goes to 1.6.3 (bug fixes / enhancements)
#
# 26.11.2012:
# I implemented photometric calibration on a run basis; version
# number is 1.6.6 now.
#
# 30.12.2012:
# many small updates for a first V0.1 run of KIDS data.
# version number goes to 1.6.7
#
# 10.01.2013:
# introduction of new error reporting and logging scheme
# version number goes to 1.7.0
#
# 18.01.2013:
# lots of small bugs for KIDS processing fixed.
# version number goes to 1.7.1
#
# 11.02.2013:
# again lots of small bugs for KIDS processing fixed.
# version number goes to 1.7.2
#
# 20.02.2013:

# version number goes to 1.7.5
#
# 16.05.2013:
# and again a lot of small bug fixes; version number goes to 1.7.6.
#
# 24.05.2013:
# upgrade to SExtractor 2.5.0 to use windowed object positions in various
# parts of the pipeline; version number goes to 1.8.0.
#
# 22.09.2013:
# I start to integrate windowed SExtractor quantities; this is done
# within version 1.9.0.
#
# 22.01.2014:
# - The code did not compile on MACOS 10.9 - fixed. Code version goes to 1.9.1
# - We now used windowed position quantities for astrometric calibration.
#
# 03.04.2014:
# - The TEMPDIR var. for progs.ini is no longer modified in this script.
#   We sat it to `pwd` in the include script itself. If the user wants to
#   change it this is done in that script anyway.
# - Version number goes to 1.9.3 - again many small fixes/refinements for
#   KIDS/ATLAS processing.
#
# 15.05.2014:
# Version number goes to 1.9.5 - again many small bug fixes during KIDS data
# processing.
