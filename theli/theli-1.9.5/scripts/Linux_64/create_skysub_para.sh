# Description:         Performs sky subtraction of FITS images

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Script history information:
# 24.09.2007:
# Script started (significant rewrite from an old script)
#
# 26.09.2007:
# - update of documentation
# - more robust treatment for a wrong skysubtraction mode
# - The subtraction modes are called ONEPASS and TWOPASS now
#
# 28.09.2007:
# - I corrected bugs in the deletion of temporary files
# - I test whether maindir/sciencedir exists at all
#
# 19.10.2007:
# The special cleanTmpFiles function (arguments)
# for this script required
# a rearrangement of the trap function handling program
# interruption.
#
# 02.10.2008:
# The saturation level keyword (SATLEVEL) is adapted
# if necessary.
#
# 12.10.2008:
# I make sure that the SATLEVEL keyword is always a float with two
# digits
#
# 26.01.2012:
# If the original image has a header keyword 'BACKGR' giving the
# skybackground value, this value is stored to a new key-value 'BACKORIG'
# and the new skybackground is given with 0.0.
#
# 08.02.2012:
# - statistics now only consider pixels between -60000 and 60000. We set
#   object pixels to -70000 and hence this couldm influence statistics if
#   large parts of an image are influenced by bright stars etc.
# - The 'correction' for small biases in the SExtractor abckground subtraction
#   is only applied if the correction is small (smaller than 1 ADU). The
#   correction is determined with global statistics which might be influenced
#   too much by large features. Hence, the 'local estimation' by SExtractor
#   with a possible small global bias is better in this case.
#
# 09.01.2013:
# I made the script more robust to non-existing files
#
# 06.02.2013:
# I added a TWOPASS_X_COLLAPSE mode to cosmetically correct remaining
# 'ramps' in the lower/upper parts of KIDS@OMEGACAM images.
#
# 05.03.2013:
# I modified deletion of temporary files so that error messages
# are avoided when no files are to be deleted.

# File inclusions:
. ./${INSTRUMENT:?}.ini
. ./bash_functions.include
theli_start "$*" "${!#}"

# define various variables because of the '-u' script flag
# (the use of undefined variables will be treated as errors!)
# several variables might be used uninitialised 
# in the cleanTmpFiles function.
