  echo "    The script creates binned mosaic images from individual chip FITS"
  echo "    files of a multi-chip instrument. The mosaic must be 'regualrly'"
  echo "    shaped, i. e. the mosaic must form a rectangle with each chip"
  echo "    having the SAME x- and y-dimensions. If this is not the case you"
  echo "    have to provide an own, instrument dependent version of this"
  echo "    script. The created image mosaics allow us an easy evaluation of"
  echo "    prereduction quality and a comfortable detection of image defects"
  echo "    that might need manual intervention."
  echo ""
  echo "    The script takes its input images from /main_dir/science_dir/,"
  echo "    creates a subdirectory BINNED and puts its results therein."
  echo "    The script gets the chip geometry from the shell variable "
  echo "    CHIPGEOMETRY in the THELI instrument definition file. "
  echo ""
  echo "    Given that individual chip FITS files have names like"
  echo "    prefix*_'CHIPNUMBER'image_extension.fits (The '*' stands for an"
  echo "    arbitrary character string) the output images get the names"
  echo "    prefix*.fits"
  echo ""
  echo "    The script launches as may processes as given in the 'NPARA'"
  echo "    enviroenment variable ('progs.ini' configuration file)."

  echo ""
  echo "    This bins all images in /aibn85_2/terben/DATA/SCIENCE_R"
  echo "    with names WFI*_'CHIP'OFCSF.fits, where 'CHIPS' stands "

  echo "    the considered instrument.    "
