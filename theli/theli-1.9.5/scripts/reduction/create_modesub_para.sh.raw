# the script subtracts the mode from the input images (with Nick
# Kaisers stats program). It is used to subtract a remaining, non
# zero, mode from swarp resampled images before they are coadded.

# 22.12.2005:
# - I introduced a prefix as selection criterium of the
#   images whose mode has to be subtracted.
# - For the extension the "." before in final .fits extension
#   has to be included in the command line argument now.
#   This avoids empty command line arguments in some 
#   circumstances.
#
# 21.03.2007:
# - I replaces an 'ls' command to search for files
#   by 'find' (more robust to long lists; no error message
#   in case that no files are present).
# - not needed, temporary, files are deleted at the end of 
#   processing.
#
# 04.09.2008:
# When subtracting the mode we leave areas which contain exactly
# zero untouched. This allows us to perform operations on such 
# areas lateron.
#
# 03.10.2008:
# if present the SATLEVEL keyword is adapted
#
# 12.10.2008:
# I make sure that the SATLEVEL keyword is always a float with two
# digits
#
# 14.08.2009:
# I forgot to include 'bash_functions.include' containing functions
# for header updates (SATURATE level keyword)
# 
# 16.09.2009:
# Bug fix when writing SATLEVEL keywords. The imagename provided
# was not correct.
#
# 07.02.2013:
# I introduced the new THELI logging scheme into the script.

# $1: main directory
# $2: science directory
# $3: prefix
# $4: extension (including a . before the fits extension)
# $5: chips to be processed
