# Instead of giving the keyword to be substituted

# I replaced the 'replacekey' command by a call to
# 'writekey'. This ensures proper treatment if the 
# script is run multiple times.

# 05.10.2008:

# 25.01.2012:
# A comment is added to the RUN key.

# 04.01.2013:
# I made the script more robust to non-existing files

# the script gives every image a RUNID 
# (it replaces a superfluous header keyword
# by RUN) (parallel version)
